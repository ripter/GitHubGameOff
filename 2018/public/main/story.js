Signs that either a very heavy Mech was released recently, or there was a heavy rain when the last Mech was released. Rex was hoping it was the former. He dreamed of capturing an Annihilator or an Atlas. Both Mechs were perfect assalt mechs for any battle team. The Star fighter in every team. Rex wanted that. He wanted to be the star, the assalt mech. The one winning champaionships and getting sponsors and fans.","\n","^Rex grew up watching the Mech fights. Everyone watched them, and every bussiness tried to cash in on them. Even as a child Rex could see that it was power; abit at the cost of freedom. He was going to get the next big Mech that came out of this port. A large flat metal surface on the ground. Rex figured it must open up or something, like an elivator shaft.","\n","^Over the next week, Rex scouted the area looking for his goal. A wild Mech. These giant machines where manufactured by humans long ago, but sometime during one of the great wars, the factories became automated. The Mechs known in Rex's time start out as wild. Their AI brain acting randomly and without commands.","\n","^If Rex was going to reach his dream of being a Mech Warrior champaion, then first he needed a Mech.","\n","^Rex followed the waypoint projected into this vision.

After Rex has built up a bunch of debt to the clan. Then the clan bets against Rex during that fight. They get the profits, and either Rex will be forced to keep working for them to pay off his debt. Or they will confiscate his Mech. Tammy, while jealous of Rex, decides that she has to warn him. She tries, and sort of works. Rex doesn't believe her, but he does call Phil and have his contract reviewed. That's where Rex finds out that all the \"free\" stuff they have been giving him is not free and they exact him to pay it all back. The rent on his home alone means he would have to win three fights a week just to keep it. That doesn't include food and everything else.
