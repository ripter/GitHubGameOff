After weeks of searching he finally found what he had been looking for. The planet was once a thriving manufacturing hub. Centered around factories that produced the giant Mechs. That was kilo years ago. The wild planet had reclaimed the entire planet and the factory ran automatically from deep underground. The only thing that remained was old ruins and exit ports. Places where mechs will occasionally appear from deep underground.","\n","^Rex laid in the grass, on a hill overlooking the remains of an ancient factory. His cybernetic eye displaying layout information. He had been watching a known exit point for over a week. Whenever or however the factory worked, it occasionally still produced a new Mech. The type and kind of Mech seemed random to Rex. (If he was a better student, he could have found loot tables on the internet, which are statistics charts breaking down the chance of any particular type of Mech being manufactured and how often they appear.)","\n","^There was large deep footprints from the exit shaft and leading away from the factory. Signs that either a very heavy Mech was released recently, or there was a heavy rain when the last Mech was released. Rex was hoping it was the former. He dreamed of capturing an Annihilator or an Atlas. Both Mechs were perfect assault mechs for any battle team. The Star fighter in every team. Rex wanted that. He wanted to be the star, the assault mech. The one winning championships and getting sponsors and fans. Having more than enough to buy himself complete freedom. Whatever he might what whenever he wanted it. That was the dream.","\n","^Rex grew up watching the Mech fights. Everyone watched them, and every business tried to cash in on them. Even as a child Rex could see that it was power; abet at the cost of freedom. He was going to get the next big Mech that came out of this port. A large flat metal surface on the ground. Rex figured it must open up or something, like an elevator shaft.","\n","^Over the next week, Rex scouted the area looking for his goal. A wild Mech. These giant machines where manufactured by humans long ago, but sometime during one of the great wars, the factories became automated. The Mechs known in Rex's time start out as wild. Their AI brain acted randomly and without commands.","\n","^If Rex was going to reach his dream of being a Mech Warrior champion, then first he needed a Mech.","\n","^Rex followed the waypoint projected into this vision. This was a known Mech factory planet, used by several of the clans. It was considered neutral, and Rex was counting on that.","\n","^Rex approached from a cliff several miles away. He pulled out a small circular object and placed it to his eye.

Then Clan Lyran would offer him a fat contract to be on their team.","\n","^Rex was mid daydream when a sonic boom overhead shook him out of it. He scanned the sky and quickly saw a drop ship landing near the factory.","\n","^\"Damn it\" Rex muttered. He quickly grabbed his gear and started sliding down the cliff face, moving as fast as he could without falling. \"I have to get to the Atlas first.\"","\n","^Galactic laws allow anyone to claim any wild mech as their own. But once claimed, taking the mech would become stealing.

Most people wore armor when attempting to capture a Mech, and personal jump jets. The personal jump jets don't exactly allow you to fly; more like they allow you to jump very very good. Someone skilled with them can appear to fly or hover by jumping off small air currents.

So let us try and figure out the highlights. Tammy watches Rex's matches, along with several other matches. Rex is winning and Tammy is getting jealous. She snoops around and hears some people talking about when the real betting is going to happen, whey they sacrifice the new kid. Their plan is to rig the fight so IronWolf loses the last match. After Rex has built up a bunch of debt to the clan. Then the clan bets against Rex during that fight. They get the profits, and either Rex will be forced to keep working for them to pay off his debt. Or they will confiscate his Mech. Tammy, while jealous of Rex, decides that she has to warn him. She tries, and sort of works. Rex doesn't believe her, but he does call Phil and have his contract reviewed. That's where Rex finds out that all the \"free\" stuff they have been giving him is not free and they exact him to pay it all back. The rent on his home alone means he would have to win three fights a week just to keep it. That doesn't include food and everything else.
