Every year I participate in [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org) to write a novel in the month of November. Recently GitHub started a November game dev jam called [Game Off 2018](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2018).

So I've combined the two, this year my NaNoWriMo is a Choose Your Own Adventure style book using [INK](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/). This allows me to focus on the work of writing a book, while also being able to create a game.

Because this is NaNoWriMo, we don't do silly things like delete or edit. We press on and continue with horrible writing. Everything can be fixed in post ðŸ˜‰
