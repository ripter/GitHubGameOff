== old
  Rex is on a planet, alone, trying to capture his first Mech.
  On his first daybreak after landing on the planet, he hikes to the old robot factory. There is an Atlas, a giant 100 ton Mech with a skeleton face.
  + Take on the biggest mech, and Atlas
    You watch the giant beast wonder around the parameter of the factory. There is no building left standing. The surface structure was destroyed in one of the many great wars long ago.
    Your occular implant overlays lines on your vision to show the known paremter and exit tunnels. The factory is still active, but unmanned. Occasionally a new Mech like the Atlas will rise from the underground factory. Without a pilot the machine is like a wild animal. The AI controller running wild with no control or direction.
    Your AR highlights the ladder going up the left leg and to the cockpit. If you can get inside, the Mech will most likely accept you as it's new pilot.
    + Sneak up on the Mech
  + Search for something easier

  Rex attempts to challenge the Atlas, but he is no match for the giant machine. He is almost killed.
  Chance he revives a critical injury

= meet_dog
  While Rex is recovering/scouting, he comes across a creature he has never seen before. It looks like a large metal dog. The creatures shoulders easily stood level with his own. It's tail ends in a series of exaust vents.
  + Rex, terrified tries to run away.
  + Curiosity over taking logic, Rex holds out a hand for the wolf creature to sniff.
  - After a brief encounter, the dog runs away, leaving Rex to wonder about the encounter.

= guild_landing
  At a landing pad near the factory, a drop ship lands. (duh, landing pad, lands, come on).
  Five people walk out of the dropship with two Mechs, an Arctic Wolf IV and a Raptor V. Both Mechs weighing 40 tons each.
  The group makes their way to where the old factory entrance once stood. Now little more than some weird looking rocks in a field.
  They made it inside the parameter before the 100 ton Atlas spotted the party.
  The Mech fires several warning shots in their direction

  From his campsite near the lake, Rex could see laser blasts coming from the factory. A few moments later he saw the bright flash and then felt the boom from a volley of short range missiles.

  The first place they went int he morning was to the local hospital. It wasn't long before they were talking with a doctor.
  A young looking woman came into the office with Rex and Tammy. "Hello, my name is Dr. Jones"
  Rex stood up the moment she walked into the room. As she greeted them, he stuck out his hand to shake hers. "Nice to meet you" he said as she shook her hand firmly but not too firmly, like he had practiced.
  Dr. Jones smiled and asked Rex to take a seat. She typed in a command and Rex's core feed his vital information into the holographic display in the office. It gave a sort of x-ray looking image, showing his internal organs and animated with his blood flowing in real time.
  Rex caught a glimpse of Dr Jones's open colored shirt. His heart started racing. He could see it in the holographic display in front of him. His own heart beating faster. He could see blood start to rush to his cheeks. Watching this happened caused his heart to race even more. He could see lights start to fire rapidly in the projected image of his brain.
  The image cut off. Dr Jones smiled. "Even with all this amazing technology, humans are still susceptible to a feedback loop." She rested her hand on Rex's shoulder and guided him back into a seated position on the exam table.
  Rex could still feel his heart pounding. He was starting to think all sorts of terrible thoughts; things that he knew were not true. But the thoughts felt heavy, like they had more weight, or were more real, than his intellectual knowledge.

  "Take a deep breath for me and hold it ok?" Dr Jone asked.
  Rex thought he saw a smile in the corner of her eyes. Something so comfortable about that look. He did as she asked. He took the deepest breath he could, and held it as long as he could.
  "Good job" she said. "I need you to do that as slow as possible a few more times for me. Can you handle that?" she asked.
  Rex focused everything on his breathing. Taking a long controlled deep breath, holding it for a moment, then just as slowly letting it out. His mind and heart calmed.

  After several physical tests and some scans, Dr Jones was ready.
  "You have a few options to replace your missing arm. Normally we would just regrow the missing limb naturally. It does mean another year before the arm is full size, and it would be a lot weaker unless you spent time exercising it back up. But you have that interface cap where your arm should go. We can't regrow your new one with that in place. We would have to remove it."
  Rex instinctavly touched the cap. It was his interface with IronWolf. In a way it felt like it was part of IronWolf as much as it was a part of himself.
  "A year? I can not afford to wait a year. I have to go back to work tomorrow." Rex protested.

  "Hmm, well" The doctor said. "You could get someone to print you a new arm. I am assuming here that you know how to interface to that port you had installed."
  Rex's face revealed his shock at the thought.
  Dr Jone noticed and elaborated. "It was the only method before we could regrow limbs. If you can believe it, humans used to use sticks and metal for limbs and joints in the ancient times. It's rare these days, but I know of a few places that still make prosthetics."
  Rex imagined a giant robot paw, like IronWolf's only scaled down to his size. "Uh thanks. are these prosthetics expensive? Could they make me one today?" Rex tried to move forward and get the embarrassing thoughts out of his mind.
  "Go and ask them yourself" Dr Jone said. She transferred the location of several shops to Rex's core.

  The problem, Rex quickly discovered, was that prosthetics was expensive. Made even more expensive because Rex did not know how his port interface worked. He would have to get someone to map it before anyone could start on the printed arm.

  Back at the clan MRB, Rex sat on his cot, looking over his bitcoins. He was broke. He felt like an idiot. He had almost all of his bitcoins in a wallet provided by Aurigan clan. Everything was tied up with IronWolf, and he was gone. Everything was gone.

  Tammy sat down next to him on the couch. "When can you pilot again?" She asked.
  Rex couldn't look up at her. "Re-growing the arm is a long process." he said.
  "Oh" Tammy said. "You have money from all your winnings right?"
  "Well, the think is" rex said. "I kept my wallet with all my winnings in IronWolf." Rex put his head in his hands. "I can't afford to wait for a replacement arm, I can not afford to buy a prosthetic  arm, I can not pilot without an arm, I can not work, or pay for a place to stay or even get IronWolf back.
  Tammy put a hand on Rex's back. He didn't shrug her off. "We will get IronWolf back. You can do it, you just need to hang in there a little bit longer. Yeah you've hit a rough patch, but you got a job here with us, and we care about you."
  Rex shrugged off Tammy's hand. "You do not get it. You have both of your arms. You have your family and your mech. You are a whole person." Rex was crying now. "I am just some freak. Without IronWolf I am nothing. I was not a good pilot because of him, he was a good mech despite of me."

== b_story
= overview
  hmm, having trouble getting this story moving. So let us try and figure out the highlights. Tammy watches Rex's matches, along with several other matches. Rex is winning and Tammy is getting jealous. She snoops around and hears some people talking about when the real betting is going to happen, whey they sacrifice the new kid. Their plan is to rig the fight so IronWolf loses the last match. After Rex has built up a bunch of debt to the clan. Then the clan bets against Rex during that fight. They get the profits, and either Rex will be forced to keep working for them to pay off his debt. Or they will confiscate his Mech. Tammy, while jealous of Rex, decides that she has to warn him. She tries, and sort of works. Rex doesn't believe her, but he does call Phil and have his contract reviewed. That's where Rex finds out that all the "free" stuff they have been giving him is not free and they exact him to pay it all back. The rent on his home alone means he would have to win three fights a week just to keep it. That doesn't include food and everything else. The match happens, Rex is kicking butt and getting farther than he ever has before. Then the final match he is defeated. The match is rigged, but Rex and Tammy can not prove it.
  ->->
= start
  Tammy quickly finished her tasks for the clan and headed out. She found out where Rex and IronWolf would be fighting. The Aurigan clan had a compound in the cheaper part of the city. Half destroyed ruins that reminded everyone of the once great history of the city. Now it serves as a home for rats and other vermin. Even the plants have re-taken several buildings, creating a quote unique ecosystem end quote.
  Tammy suspected that the Aurigan clan liked the ruins nearby because it made it easier to hide their illegal actives.
  The Arena was a few kilometers from the Aurgian clan compound. It was strictly outside the city limits. Some laws or regulations meant that a city could only have one official arena. But that didn't stop the bigger clans like Aurgian from setting up their own outside the city.

  Tammy bought a ticket and entered the stadium. It was packed. The main area when you walked in was a long line of betting booths. You verified your core, deposited some money and then got access to the arenas gambling channels. If you won, you went back to the booth and scared your core to withdraw your winnings. If you lose, they already have your money do it's a quick trip to the street.

  Tammy got a seat near the back of the arena. She could make out the giant mechs below, but it was small and they moved fast. Screens around the arena showed close action shots and highlights. She focused more on those screens than on the fight below. But there was something lacking from watching a screen.

  Before Rex's fight, there is a preview of the Grand Champion, a pilot for Clan Aurigan. An open challenge for anyone that wanted to take him on in his Atlas. There were a few takers, their Mechs coming out of the visitor entrance. Tammy wondered if they were regulars, and brought their Mech for the fight, or if they were stooges placed by Clan Aurigan to warm up the crowd. Whatever they where, they barely managed to last a few minutes against the massive Atlas.

  Rex was announced a new new young challenger. The announcer claimed he worked his way up from the deep penitentiary mines. Brought up for his chance to win his freedom. Tammy rolled her eyes at this, she suspected much of the "backgrounds" for the competitors are made up. After his wins, the announcer said Rex won his right to fight in the next round, beating out all the competitors and sending them back into the mines.

  "Will Rex make his way to fight the grandmaster Champion and his Atlas?" The announcer teased.
  Tammy read the book, Rex would have to fight in several more matches like this before he reaches the grand master. Tammy watched the other battles. There were some serious competitors in this arena. Some of them might be able to make it in the official Championship. This week's winner got his match against the Atlas.

  * Camelot, 75 tons.
    Heavy armor.
    Weapons: 1 Gauss Rifle, armored; 2 one-shot long range streaking missiles. 2 Medium range lasers.
    Equipments: Re-enforced armor; Anti-Missile counter measures.
  * Atlas, 100 tons.
    Heavy Armor.
    Weapons: 2 Long Range Missile Racks, 4 short range Heavy Lasers; 1 Gauss Rifle.
  -

  "Ouch" Tammy said. This did not seem like an even match. The Camelot is basically a lighter version of the Atlas. Even their load-out was similar.

  When the match started, both the Atlas and the Camelot opened fired with their long range missiles. The Camelot's missiles left a thick white fog as the flew thought the air. Causing the battlefield to become cloudy and less visible.
  Explosions rocketed in the fog. The Screens showed footage from the drones flying around the battle field.

  A bright light flashed for a moment; followed by a ear thundering boom. The Camelot fired its Gauss Rifle in the fog. There was no flash on the other end, so the shot must have missed. On the screen the announcer confirmed the miss.
  Four bright red beams swept the arena, burning away the lingering fog.

  The Camelot revealed as the the fog burned away. It was still at long range, but had moved quite far along the arena.
  The Atlas fired another rack of Missiles forcing the Camelot to move closer to the Atlas.

  "The classic death trap" The announcer said, "Missiles behind to force the pray forward and into a clear shot for that Gauss Rifle."

  A bright flash of white light, followed by a boom as the Atlas fired it's Guass Rifle. The projectiles hit the Camelot square in the chest, where its armor is heaviest. The back of the Camelot exploded in fire and debris. The Mech fell forward and it's pilot ejected.

  "Great try by Camelot!" the announcer said. "our boy Atlas is still the champion. But we all expected that."

  After the match, the crowed started filing out. Some people grumbling and others excited and talking about how they are going to spend their winnings.

  * [Next]
  -
  Tammy replayed the last attack on her internal screens. The Camalot has anti-missile countermeasures, so why did he fall for the missile diversion?

  By the time she got up to leave, most of the crowd was gone, leaving only the people that worked for the arena to clean up and wrap up the last bits of business. Tammy made her way down to the arena floor, lingering just at the edges, enough that everyone that was there didn't pay her any attention. She listened to the people working. She was not from this sort of area, but she knew people who worked in garages and she really knew people. She blended in and listened, she followed and watched people talk. She made her way to a bar in the old ruins outside arena.

	-
	It was  poorly lit, a live band played on a stage, but nobody was there for the band. They sounded terrible and Tammy was pretty sure they were not even playing the same song. A group of gear heads, or whatever you call these people, had taken up a long table and two booths. It was clear everyone knew each other. Their jackets piled up in a corner without care; either because they knew and trusted everyone around, or because they didn't have anything worth stealing, everyone worked at the garage and had the same shit. Tammy sat at the bar and nerced a drink. A couple of guys were talking loud and drunk near her. Something drunk guys often did, some dumb idea that she would overhear how important they were and fall in love with them.

  * [Next]
  -
	"Yeah, we got something special with this new Mech" one drunk guy said. "Real advanced stuff."
	"That kid is piloting it right?" another drunk said.
	"Ha, for now. Once the kid finishes his run we get the Mech." the drunk said.
	"Kid agreed to that?" a voice said.
	"Yeah sure, buy the time the contract comes out they are so far under in booze and drugs that they never read the damn thing." the drunk said.
	"Funny how that works" someone said.
	"Dumb kid should read the thing he sold the next ten years of his life too." The drunk said.

	Tammy made her way out, just as invisibly as she made her way in.

	"I can not let them get IronWolf" Tammy said to herself. "That Mech is something special. Those hacks would chop him up and never realize the destroyed opportunity." But how would she  do it. She called up Phil. "Clan Aurigan is planning on stealing IronWolf" she said.

	"How so?" Phil asked. He was not looking at her, he was in the middle of doing something else, so his image only partially showed him.
	"Contract bullshit. They got him as a gladiator" Tammy said.
  "Maybe he will win" Phil said.
  "Pretty hard to win a rigged fight." Tammy responded.
  "Do you have proof?" Phil asked.
  "No" she admitted. "but I do not want those hacks to dismantle IronWolf before I get my chance at revenge."
  "You'll never take down a Clan of that size. I can not even help you there." Phil said.
  "I do not need to take them down or expose them. We just need to give Rex a fair chance. If he screws up on his own then nothing with save that boy."
  "Alright, I have an improved scanner that might help you." Phil said.

  Tammy was forming a plan. First she needed to figure out how they were cheating, she would also need to figure out when they where planning on taking Rex down. She guessed they would let his fan base build up for the next month at least. Then he would face the best of the best and the Atlas. The existing champion proving why the dumb rookie still needs to improve. Like a battle between at 10 ton Mech and a 100 ton mech is even remotely fair.

  When Rex got home that morning, IronWolf was gone.
  Rex was still hung over from the long night. It took his delayed brain a moment to piece together what was different about the place. The 9 meter tall 10 ton mech was missing. That's such a big thing to be missing that Rex's mind rejected the idea at first, trying to find another reason. Maybe the Mech is in the bathroom? But he wouldn't fit thought the door, maybe he went out for a walk, except he's never done that before. Playing a game? hiding? maybe an appointment Rex had forgotten?
  Tammy was the first to speak. "Where is IronWolf?" was all she said.

  * [Next] 
  -
  
  Rex quickly navigated the screens displayed only in his vision, finding the channel between him and IronWolf.

  Rex: Hey were did you go?

  There was no response. Rex waiting for a long moment. That was unusual, IronWolf was always available. It's not like he was asleep or out partying or something.

  Reality hit Rex like a ton of bricks swinging from a doorway into the heads of would be robbers. "Someone stole IronWolf!" Rex screamed.

  After contacting security, they looked over the security footage for the area around Rex's garage apartment. IronWolf never came back after the losing battle in the arena. A flew calls later Rex found himself in the office of head of security for the Aurigan clan. Samson was a gruff and grizzled looking war veteran. Rex felt intimidated.

  * [Next] 
  -
  
  "Your mech was confiscated." Samson said without emotion or tone.
  "Confiscated? by who? that does not make any sense" Rex stuttered.
  "It is all in the contract you signed." The old man pulled out a file from this core and transferred it to Rex. Soon he had the signed document in front of him. The old man made a gesture and the document scrolled to show the clause. "Right here, if you miss a payment on your apartment, we get to confiscate your Mech for 30 days."
  "What happens after 30 days?" Rex asked, already feeling the frustration of the old man.
  The man swiped and kept reading the text out loud on the screen for the boy. "After 30 days, if you still have an outstanding debt with the clan, arena, or it's staff, then your mech and any other assets will be forfeited to the clan to replay your debts."
  "So I have 30 days to pay a debt I didn't realize I had or else you take away all my stuff?" Red asked.
  "Pretty much" said Samson. "Look, can I give you some advice kid?"
  "I guess" Rex said.
  "You are learning a valuable life lesson here. Don't trust anyone and read everything before you sign." Samson walked back to his desk, making it clear that he was done without actually telling Rex to leave.
  Rex, taking the hint said thanks and walked out of the office and the Aurigan clan's complex. Tammy was waiting outside with a car.

  "Why?" is all rex could manage to say.
  Tammy and Rex rode in silence on their way back to the small building Clan MRB was using.
  
  * [Next] 
  -
  
  "Welcome back" Phil said when they walked in the doors.
  Rex looked up at him. "You are helping me? Why?"
  Phil shook his head. "No no, I am hiring a pilot that is having a bit of bad luck."
  Rex looked skeptical.
  "Look, I am not going to try and fleece you like those other guys, but I am not running a charity either. The offer I gave you when we first landed still applies. You work hard and I'll pay you. You can spend a few weeks living here until you have enough money for your own place."
  "But IronWolf" Rex stuttered.
  "Real shame about your Mech, but as luck would have it, we do have a spare. You can borrow it free of charge, until you get IronWolf back that is."
  Rex perked up at this. "Get him back?"
  Tammy playfully punched Rex in the shoulder. "Of course, like you would let someone just take IronWolf from you."
  "Well" Rex said, "I have been thinking of a way to locate him." Rex said.

  Before Rex and locate IronWolf, he needs to earn some money and gather information. So he must fight the urge to run out int he streets screaming IronWolf's name.

  Phil has Tammy and Rex do a test battle, so Rex can get comfortable with the borrowed Mech. A Blackjack, a 40 ton mech equipped with 2 Lasers ,2 Autocannons, and jump jets.

  When Rex first sees the cockpit of the Blackjack he is take aback. It is nothing like he was used to inside of IronWolf. A large leather chair in the center of an orb made of screens and controllers. Rex sat in the seat and tried to take it all in. He realized that he didn't even know how to turn it on. He started to panic, not sure what to do or how to explain. "Uh guys" He said.
  Phil and Tammy walked into view and looked at him form where they were.
  "I think this was made for people with two arms" he said while pointing to his stump.

  "Oh" Phil said. "Yeah I had been wondering how you pilot IronWolf so well with only one arm."
  
  * [Next]
  -
  
  Rex was not sure what he should answer. He could guess from everyone's reaction that the virtual reality interface he was used to did not exist in the ancestor mechs. "I uh, am lucky that I got a mech that only needs one arm" he suggested.
  "It might be easier to get you a new arm" Tammy suggested.
  Rex never really considered a replacement for his arm before. Inside of IronWolf he had both arms, and outside. Rex noticed for the first time that he had a hard time remembering much form outside IronWolf. Sure he went to some parties and danced a little. But over the last X time units, almost all of his time had been with IronWolf, inside IronWolf.
  The sudden realization of his lost arm hit him with the gravity of realizing he lost his entire body. He was IronWolfs frontal cortex. He was the brain, and his body, like his arm, was lost to him.

  * [Next]
  -
  Emotions flooded Rex's mind, leaving his swimming in darkness. "I uh, need some air." he said as he studdenly stood up and walked out the door.
  
  As he walked down the sidewalk, he started to worry that Phil and everyone will think he was being a jack ass or something. He rudely left. He just needed to think. That is what he kept telling himself.
  He did not know the city, so he just walked randomly, trying to avoid the larger crowds. Before he had come back to reality, he was standing in front of an older looking parts store. The neon sign sparked and the door was barely wide enough for Rex to enter.
  It was the strangeness of it that called to him, at least Rex would later descided that was the case. He had been so wrapped up in a cycle of emotions and stress and he could not think anymore. And that is how he ended up walking down a long barely lit hallway.
  As he walked, Rex wanted to turn around, maybe leave to or back. The hall way was impossibly long, much longer than the building looked deep. It turned at a sharp ninty degree angle and ended abruptly. There was a counter, with a robotic clerk working behind a cage.
  The tears that Rex would never admit, had stopped. An agumented message apeared over the robot, it said "Parts"
  "Can I help you Sir?" the Robot asked.
  "I uh, I don't know." Rex stammered. His mind suddenly trying to puzzle something together. He had needed parts, back when he had IronWolf.
  Like a facit, the tears turned back on. Rex turned around an quick stepped back out into the street. He tried using his one arm to whip away the tears, but it made his actions to obvious and drew looks from others on the street.
  "Why was life so unfair to me?" Rex thought. "I work hard, I am smart. What more can I possibly do? What more must I scrifice"
//   Why should 
  Eventually Rex found himself sitting alone in an unlit alley. He just sat there in silence, letting the emeotions fill him and feeling them flush out of him. He yelled and ran and punched the air. Anything and everything to burn though the cycle before it could consume him.
//   "I need some time to think" Rex said and ran out of the building. Rex ran down the street and into the city. He was not thinking about were he was going, so his feet followed the easiest path. He found himself outside the parts shop in town. The one he had visited so many times when getting the materials IronWolf needed to upgrade. In a sense, it was a second home to Rex. He knew every part on the shelves and all the possibilities he had, when he had IronWolf. Tears filling his eyes, Rex pressed on, forcing himself to walk down streets he had never visited. He didn't want to see anything that reminded him of his life, of IronWolf. His mind was whirling with anger and regret and fear. Rex stumbled into a park and found a bench. He sat there and cried. All of his pent up frustrations and anger. It all came pouring out of him in big wet drops. Everything had happened so fast that he never really had a chance to process everything. He had no home to go back to, he couldn't even pilot a real mech. And as he realized he was unconsciously rubbing at the stub were his arm used to be. he wasn't even a full person anymore he thought to himself.

  Hours later, drained both physically and emotionally, Rex walked back to clan MRB, found the cot that was laied out for him, and laied down. His eyes open and staring at the wall. When morning came, he got out of bed and joined the rest of the team for breakfast.

  "Good Morning" Phil said. "First thing we need to take care of is getting you up to speed piloting the Blackjack".
  Rex was not in the mood, but he had grown up enough to not respond with a sarcastic or mean retort; which was his first thought.
  "Tammy" Phil said. "Help rex get a new arm."
  "Uh thanks but" Rex started.
  "Consider the arm a starting bonus. I need you up to speed asap so you and Tammy can get to work."
  "I kept forgetting to ask, what kind of work?" asked Rex.
  "Oh a bit of this and a bit of that" Willson asked. "Do you know what MRB stands for?"
  Rex shook his head.
  "Neither do I, but when I get a job from the head office, I take it." Willson said.

# Battle
Two mechs battle each other in an arena. The winner is the mech that survives the longest without overheating.
* Terms:
  * Turn: one or more rounds.
  * Round: Both mechs have performed all the moves/actions they are going to perform before the next turn. ~this turn.~


### Battle Style: Volley by Volley
* start turn (aka recharge)
* Confirm speed upkeep.
* loop until both players can not continue:
  * Each Mech performs 1 action or skips.
  * Check for game over


# Idea: Full Single Turn
Each "player" take a full turn to set their mech speed, and fire whatever weapons they are going to fire for this battle. Speed or random can determine who takes their turn first. The cost of whatever the player wants to do during the turn is subtracted after the turn is confirmed. Damage to the opponent is applied then, the opponent gets the opportunity to take their turn. After each player takes a turn, the round is over, game over is checked, then power recharges and heat dissipates.

* Each mech spends some or all of their POWER
* affects of a mech's turn (like damage) apply once they confirm their turn.
* After both mechs take their turn
  * check game over
  * recharge and start a new turn.


# Idea: Volley by Volley Turn
Each player takes turns performing an ACTION, one after the other. Each mech does one ACTION, then the other mech gets a chance to take an ACTION. Once both Mechs pass, the turn ends, game over is checked, and recharge happens.

* Mechs confirm movement spending. (Then movement upkeep is paid)
* Mechs take turns performing some actions until either they skip, or run out of POWER.
* After each volley, game over is checked.
* After each round, recharge happens.

  The Challenger: {attacker} is a 12 meter tall bipedal machine of war. This man shaped mech, weighing in at 65 tons, weilds a hatchet for a left hand! A devistating melee attack. His other hand features three medium lasers, and he has a special surprise hidden in the chest, an autocannon.
  The Defender: {defender} is a 9 meter tall bipedal machine of war. Some would say this armless mech looks more like a bird. It has a missile rack on each shoulder instead of arms. It has four medum lasers mounted in long nose or beak of the mech.

== opening_image
  Rex watching a Mech fight on a display, from the factory planet.
  This is the audience's introduction to Mech Battles and why they should keep reading. (Giant Robot Battles FTW!)
  ->->

== opening_image_draft2
  Rex was sitting next to a campfire along a quiet crystal lake. No signs of humans or civilization could be seen for miles an every direction. Rations cooked on the campfire while Rex was focused on the display projected into his field of view by his cybernetic eyes. On the display he could see the Mech Warrior Grand Tournament.
  Two teams of Mech start on either side of an area. As the announcer speaks, the area transforms into a rocky scene with a river running though it.
  The area used solid holograms to create the battle scape. Keeping the audience and arena safe.
  Team Lyran, Mechs all painted with blue battle colors, quickly spreads across the battle field. Their tank, a Banshee. This 95 ton mech was built for close combat, runs at full speed towards the rivers that divides the arena. it has a load out of two Arm Actuators, each powering an arm. Flamers sounding the Mech, causing it to look like it is wearing a coat of flames when active.
  The other two Mech on the Lyran side quickly activate stealth and disappeared except for a faint shimmer of light. According to the announcer they were a Black Knight, a laser heavy Mech known for overheating; And an Orion loaded out with Long Range Missiles.
  ->->



== setup_one
  Rex is out searching for a wild Mech he can claim. He meets IronWolf, who runs off. (foreshadow Rex's lack of real control over IronWolf)
  Rex finds a small clan (M.R.B. working for master) working to try and subdue a giant 100 ton Atlas. Rex, being overly ambitious and confident tries to highjack the hunt and steal the Atlas himself. During the fight he gets badly injured (losing an arm) and is about to die.
  IronWolf, who was watching Rex for a while, runs out of the woods at Rex. Before the Atlas crushes him, IronWolf leaps over Rex, transforming and pulling Rex into the cockpit at the same time. The fully extended 10 ton IronWolf howls in triumph.
  BETTER: Rex loses the arm as IronWolf saves him. The Mech is too late to save him completely, Rex's arm getting caught under the giant foot. As IronWolf transforms and pulls him into the cockpit, Rex's trapped arm is ripped off. Pulled out of the socket.
  ->->

== theme_stated
  Now inside IronWolf, Rex tries to pilot the Mech away form the battle. He is bleeding badly and starting to lose consciousness.
  IronWolf refuses, growling and snarling at the larger Atlas.
  Rex thought he would control IronWolf absolutely, but the AI is able to do what it wants. It considers Rex controls as suggestions.
  Rex loses consciousness from blood loss.
  ->->

== setup_two
  When Rex wakes up, he is laying back at his camp. IronWolf is laying next to him. A mess of wires and tubes running from IronWolf to Rex's missing arm.
  His shoulder hurts and is sore, but Rex will survive. Assuming he can get back home to real medical treatment.
  Rex is surprised IronWolf was able to heal him.
  IronWolf learns the ability "Heal"
  ->->

== catalyst
  Rex needs to get home for real medical treatment, but he was a stowaway to get to the planet in the first place. He ran away from home, and has no were else to turn.
  In training with IronWolf, they find the MRB drop ship and camp. The other new recruits having captured a couple of 20 ton Mechs. No sign of the Atlas that almost killed Rex.
  The MRB Clan detects Rex and his Mech (in battle form). They approach him and he asks for transport.
  Rex's nemesis Tammy refuses and blames Rex for him losing the Atlas. After talking about it the senior clan members agree to give Rex a chance to prove himself; if he can beat his nemesis Tammy in one on one combat. If Rex loses, then he is responsible for the lost Atlas. If Rex wins, then his nemesis had no chance of success; invalidating his complaint.
  Agreed, Rex and his nemesis move into position for a battle.
  ->->

== debate_draft_one
  In the start of the fight, Rex is confident and IronWolf responds quickly to his commands.
  As the fight drags on, IronWolf becomes annoyed with Rex's fighting style and starts to act on his own, ignoring Rex. Abandoning the traditional Mech fighting that we say Rex watch on screen, and instead fight using the environment and surprise.
  IronWolf defeats the other Mech and ejects Rex out. But he does not transform back into the wolf while around the others.
  ->->
== debate
  Rex arrives on the planet with clan MRB after getting a tie in the fight with Tammy. Tammy proving she is the more skilled fighter, but Rex able to use a next generation mech and fight in new ways.
  Phil offers Rex a chance to work with their crew after seeing his Mech repaired. Phil assuming Rex is a wiz kid of some sorts. That would explain his strange and very custom Mech.
  At first Rex is still grateful for the ride and helps Clan MRB, but eventually Rex wants to do everything on his own. He needs to prove himself to the world, and he feels like he can't do that if he accepts help. His arrogance causing him to take risks. He wins some underground fights, earning himself a bit of cash and getting the attentions of Clan Aurigan.
  Rex has to make a choice, take Clan Aurigan's offer and fight in the underground and make a lot of money. Or Join up with Phil and Tammy with Clan MRB and fight in the official tournaments.
  Clan Aurigan wines and dines Rex, offering him everything in the world he could want. Everything he really wanted when he thought he wanted to be Mech Warrior Champion.
  To Rex, it looks like Clan Aurigan is offering him a shortcut to the real reasons he wanted to be a champion. Fame, money, and the depths of sleaze those things bring.
  ->->

== break_into_two_draft_one
  On the ride home, while they are alone. IronWolf and Rex talk about the fight. About how Rex is upset that IronWolf did not listen to him. IronWolf tells Rex that he has never had control of him. That he sees Rex as a guide, but not his master. IronWolf wants to explore the galaxy, but he does not understand humans or the our ways.
  ->->
== break_into_two
  Rex agrees to Clan Aurigan's offer and dives into the underworld fighting. At first he is winning and being treated like a king, everything he asks for. Then his manager tells him he has to take a dive. The Clan will make a killing off his loss. This is their investments in him paying off.
  IronWolf refuses to take a dive. Rex is unsure, he can repair IronWolf after all.
  The pair struggle in the battle for control, and IronWolf is struck down and loses the fight. Clan Aurigan pays him, but Rex suddenly finds himself with the sleps he was beating before. During his next fight, he is asked to take another dive.
  Rex starts to wonder if his fights were fixed, if he is really a good fighter or not.
  ->->

== b_story_draft_one
  Rex's nemesis, Tammy suspects that Rex cheated somehow. She takes some scans of IronWolf and discovers the Mech does not match any known models. It's flagged as a new unknown model.
  Tammy, spies on part of Rex's conversation with IronWolf, revealing that Rex is not in control. She plans to use this against him.
  ->->
== b_story
  Tammy has been following Rex's progress in the underground fights. She sees the arena master cheat to disable IronWolf in his losing match.
  # Tammy confronts Rex with proof, and discovers that IronWolf is more
  Confronted with the truth, Rex realizes he is in over his head and needs help. He tries to escape with Tammy. She helps him once he comes clean about IronWolf to her. She wants her own next generation Mech, and Rex convinces IronWolf to promise to lead her to one.
  When they try to leave, Clan Aurigan stops them and takes both IronWolf and Wolfhound from them.
  ->->

== fun_and_games_draft_one
  Back on planet side, Tammy suggests that Rex stay with them until he can find a place of his own. He can't just walk a 10 ton war machine down main street.
  Reluctantly, Rex agrees. IronWolf does not like being locked up in a garage. At first they are able to get out at night so IronWolf can run around and change back into his normal wolf form.
  With help from the clan, they help Rex join one of the battle leagues.
  This section is a bunch of Mech Battles. Rex and IronWolf get stronger, get more skills and abilities.
  As time passes IronWolf grows restless and starts to resent Rex.
  ->->
== fun_and_games
  When Phil and Willson learn that Clan Aurigan and taken the Mechs. They call the local law enforcement, who ask for proof of ownership.
  None of the new Mechs had beed registered since they landed plant side. The only proof of ownership was possession, and the Aurigan clan possessed both Mechs.
  Rex and Tammy break into the garage from the arcana, but their Mechs are no longer there.
  Rex and Tammy come up with a plan to get their Mech back, and get Phil and Willson to help them.
  They have to hack their way into clan Aurigan's database to find out where their Mechs were taken.
  # They get the location of a garage in the old district. Filled with the poor living in the ruined buildings of the past.
  They get the location of a garage in the middle of the city. The pair break in, get their Mechs back, and then have a Mech battle in the city to get out. Rex, Tammy, Phil, and Willson all want to avoid anyone getting hurt. Their plan resolves around deception.
  Once they get the mechs out of the living city and into one of the old dead cities. They are confronted by clan Aurigan, having a four versus five intercity mech battle. Buildings be damned.
  ->->

== midpoint_draft_one
  IronWolf starts to grow restless and start to resent Rex. He does not like being in his Battle mode for long periods of time. And the times he gets to run around in his wolf form is getting rarer as they move up the ranks in battle. He also wants to explore the planet outside of the battle ring.
  ->->
== midpoint
  After rescuing IronWolf and Wolfhound, and defeating/losing to clan Aurigan. They return home.
  IronWolf reveals his feelings to Rex. That he doesn't see much difference between being locked up by clan Aurigan, or by Rex.
  Rex tries to reassure IronWolf, but then does something stupid. IronWolf runs away.
  ->->

== bad_guys_close_in_draft_one
  The Aurigan clan runs the arena Rex and friends have been fighting in. One of them noticed the strange IronWolf mech. He rigs a fight so IronWolf's reactor will be badly damaged and will need to shut down.
  IronWolf is defeated, and ejects Rex before compressing down into it's wolf form. In front of the entire arena. The place goes crazy and with Tammy's help, Rex and IronWolf barely manage to get back to the garage.
  ->->

== bad_guys_close_in
  Rex has to battle for the first time in an old generation Mech. And he loses horribly, costing the clan the match.
  Depressed, Rex is angered and frustrated that he could not keep IronWolf happy. He can not understand how his actions resulted in IronWolf comparing him to the ones that kidnapped him.
  ->->


== all_is_lost_draft_one
  IronWolf disappears. Rex thinks he has been kidnapped, Tammy thinks/hopes IronWolf just ran away.
  Tammy reveals to the group that Rex was never in control, and that the Mech could be a gold mine in the right hands.
  The group kicks out Rex, and plans to find and recapture IronWolf on their own.
  Rex is back to how he started, except worse because now he misses IronWolf. He is friendless, penny less, and homeless on an uncaring planet. Without IronWolf he can't even get a job.
  ->->
== all_is_lost
  Rex and the clan's last chance to win their way into the tournament, and Rex is still fumbling around in an old generation Mech. They lose the battle again.
  Tammy blames Rex for the losses of both IronWolf and the match. But she does not say anything about his promise to lead her to a next generation Mech. Tammy wants to be a bitch to him because she is angry, but she is not that cruel. She is really upset because she thought she could win without Rex's help. But without Rex and IronWolf, she failed too. The entire team failed. Tammy didn't want to believe that she and her clan could need Rex.
  Tammy pushes Rex away, trying to prove to herself that she does not need him. She ends up getting Rex to leave on his own.
  ->->

== dark_night_of_the_soul_draft_one
  Rex is going to get IronWolf back, no matter what. He plans to break into Aurigan clan's complex.
  He calls in every favor and makes some dangerous promises to get the resources he needs. His money having been confiscated by the M.R.B when they kicked him out.
  Using skills he learned training with IronWolf, he gets inside the complex and finds IronWolf in a cage, in his wolf form. Two Atlas guard the garage. Rex is able to get inside, but he would be caught trying to leave with the 10 ton mech.
  ->->
== dark_night_of_the_soul
  Without a Mech or a place to stay, Rex quickly burns though the money he has and feels worthless. He can not get even a basic job because of his missing arm.
  Rex tries a doctor to see if he can get a replacement arm, but it is too expensive for him now. It's a price that seemed inconsequential when Rex was on top, but now it is a vast sum that is keeping him from being anything other than a beggar on the street.
  Rex barely manages to scrape enough money to get a basic arm.
  # On his way to get it, he overhears someone talking about a really weird four legged Mech clan Aurigan used to win a spot at the tournament.
  On this way to get his arm, or not, he overhears a dock worker talk about a crazy four legged wolf mech Clan Kirby just bought.
  ->->

== break_into_three_draft_one
  Rex runs into Tammy, who is also there to free IronWolf. For a moment they start fighting each other, then almost get caught by security.
  Tammy questions Rex, bringing up his lack of control.
  Rex wonders if any of them are ever really in control. No one was piloting the Atlas that calmed his arm. Maybe all they can do is try to set things up for success.
  Tammy finally agrees to help Rex, if he will help her get her own next generation Mech.
  ->->
== break_into_three
  Rex is determent to go with IronWolf as his pilot. But he has no idea how to approach it. So he goes back to the only people who have been there for him, Phil, Whilson, and Tammy at clan MRB.
  With some hustle, Phil gets a member of Clan Kirby to have a meeting with Rex. At the meeting, the clan Kirby representative does not want to let the boy pilot.
  After some convincing, he agrees if the boy can win a fight using IronWolf. It seems that the Mech's cockpit was missing any sort of controls or screens. No one had yet been able to pilot IronWolf. So if the boy could do it, he could use IronWolf to apply for membership to clan Kirby.
  Tammy insists on coming or stowaway.
  ->->

== finale_draft_one
  The other members of the M.R.B clan cause a distraction and together Rex and Tammy are able to wake up IronWolf and escape the complex.
  ->->
== finale
  Rex fights the pilot of CopperBanshee. Both next generation Mechs.
  Rex does not know Banshee is a next generation mech called CopperBanshee until part way though the fight.
  During the fight, Rex is stopped at every turn. It starts to become clear that CopperBanshee is messing with Rex.
  In anger Rex manages to hit CopperBanshee. The fight is over and Clan Kirby agrees to let him join as a junior member.
  After the fight, Rex watches CopperBanshee transform down into a large cleaning white metal rabbit.
  With both next generation Mechs transformed back into their normal states. The wolf and the rabbit sniff at each other before running around and playing.
  ->->

== final_image_draft_one
  Rex, Tammy, and the other members of their small clan reach a ridge on some unknown planet. (Maybe IronWolf had an idea?)
  They overlook a cliff. A Large metal bird flies over them. Orange engine exhaust coming from under the Falcon's wings.
  The bird lands in front of IronWolf and caws loudly at the Mech.  IronWolf roars back and both Mechs transform into Battle Mode.
  Rex and Tammy smile at each other before running off to join the Mechs.
  ->->
== final_image
  Rex, Tammy, and the pilot of CopperBanshee are standing at a cliff. When they look down, clouds and fog obscure the bottom. A large metal bird fly out though the fog and overhead.
  "That" IronWolf said, "Is SteelFalcon, as promised Tammy."
  Tammy jumps off the cliff, activating her personal jump jets and flies after the large metal bird.
  The pilot of CopperBanshee tells Rex that they have been approved to fight for Clan Kirby in this years Tournament. Three next generation mechs could be unstoppable.
  ->->

  > People are the sum of their actions, not the sum of their intentions.

  "What's that?" Tammy asked. She, Rex, and Will were all getting breakfast in the kitchen. Rex's eyes were glossed over as he focused on the screens only he could see. the screens his core displayed over his vision. His hands moved silently in the air like a ghost playing a long gone piano.
  Tammy sat down next to him. The jostling of weight as she sat down was enough to bring Rex's attention back to the real world. "What are you up to?" she asked again.
  "I am going to get IronWolf back." Rex said confidently.
  "Yeah, you said that before." Tammy said with a mouth full of food.
  "I never gave up!" Rex's face flushed.
  Tammy put her spoon slowly back in her bowl. "Calm down, I never said anything about giving up. I thought you were about to tell me your big plan. How you are going to convince us to help you do something reckless and illegal." Tammy resumed eating.
  "Oh," Rex held his head low, "sorry" he mumbled.
  She smiled at him, food dropping from her parted mouth back into the bowl. "Thank you for understanding. Now tell me your plan already."
  Willson sat down with his own bowl of food. "Yeah, if I am going to get arrested for breaking into a compound then you better have a good plan."
  Phil sat down. He did not have any food or coffee, like Rex they had been up for a while and already ate.

  * All eyes on Rex
  -
  For a moment panic filled Rex's mind, he felt the panic, then he let it wash over him and took a deep breath to expel the emotion. Not suppress it, but feel it and then let it free.
  "Here is the plan:" Rex said as he explained his idea.
  "You are going to get us killed" Tammy said.
  "We battle in giant machines originally built for war for a living. When are we not going to get killed?" Rex said.
  "I can get us some blank cores" Wilson said.


  * [Operation: Rescue IronWolf]
  -
  The first step was for Rex and Tammy to do some team fights and lose. It would be easy because Rex really was terrible at piloting the Blackjack. A few battles and their ranking plummeted. The networks picked up on the loses. Interviewing the team.

  (Writer's note: this would be a great place to let the player play as Tammy instead of Rex. Since they need to lose, the player can get slightly different objectives like destroy one mech before Rex loses, or stay alive for X turns. Al thought this would be a team battle and I barely have the single player battle working.)

  "Rex" Sally Xuo, a gaming reporter asked, "You were the rising star piloting IronWolf correct?"
  Rex leaned forward to answer, but Wilson was first. "Correct Sally. It is a very sad story, but one that is becoming quite common."
  "Oh" Sally acted surprised and gasped. "You poor child" She said. "You lost your arm in a battle?"
  Rex instinctively grabbed at the cap were his arm used to be. He felt dirty, but he was determined.
  "Even worse!" Wilson said, "Oh Rex tell them about your arm and IronWolf."
  The camera focused on Rex. His world became a little blinking light. "I lost my arm a long time ago, before I was a pilot." He said. "IronWolf was made special, for people like me with only one arm." He intentionally rubbed the missing limb in front of the camera.
  "Thats amazing, it is so wonderful that there are still people out there willing to help the differently abled people out there." Sally smiled at the camera. "But some of my views are going to ask, why not regrow your arm?"
  Wilson had big tears in his eyes. "Poor boy can not. He was born without his arm. We spend so much money trying to regrow it, but it just wont take."
  "How amazing" Sally said.
  "My family's entire fortune was spent retrofitting IronWolf specifically for me." Rex lied.

  "As you can see from recent battle" Wilson said. "We are losing a fortune and I bet so are a lot of you. Rex lost IronWolf in a rigged fight. And he is not the only one."
  Sally's gasp seemed real this time. "Rigged fights? That is very serious."
  "It is" Wilson said. "The arena fights not only create a large health economy, but they also keep us out of the perpetual war our ancestors grew up with."
  "Do you have proof?" Sally asked.
  Rex stood up, tears filling his eyes. "Have you seen anyone else able to pilot IronWolf?" He half screamed squeaked out. Wilson and Sally also stood, wrapping their arms around the crying one armed boy.
  After a moment and everyone was settled. Sally finished the program.

  In the greenroom Sally came up to Rex and Wilson. "Did they really cheat?" she asked. "Because I lost a lot of money when Rex lost. I was actually pretty mad at you Rex. I was prepared to tear into you."
//  Wilson brought up a holograph display. "Look at the average length of any contender in say, the other clans arena. Just an example, not picking on them. But look. The average length of a rising star is about six months; just long enough to reach the Campion lose, and start the entire cycle all over again."
  Wilson brought up a display with the data. He highlighted the average length of time every rising star spent getting to the top and then losing everything.
  "That does not prove anything" Sally said. "It is a tournament, the matches happen at set intervals. The definition of rising start is someone who keeps winning, beating the odds and expectations. Your data just shows that the word is being applied correctly."

//  Sally read over the data carefully. Then she made a gesture that saved the information to her core. "Right or wrong, the other clan is going to come after you for this. You are prepared right?"
  Rex looked Sally in the eyes. "I really did lose my arm, my livelihood, and my only real best friend. And we know, just like everyone else, that the arena fights are rigged." Rex looked away and took a deep breath. "The truth is what is important right? The truth is that they are cheating."
// Rex said.
  Sally looked a him, watching his expression. "sure kid."
  "I am not a kid" Rex blurted.
  "I do not care if you are 100 years old, for this story to work you are kid." Sally snapped. She was no longer looking at him, but had glazed over her eyes as she looked at screens only visible to her. "There are a lot of old fogies in my way that do not know when to retire."

  Almost every news channel was flooded for the next week. Testimonies, interviews, expert opinions. Everyone had something to say about the alleged cheating by Clan Aurigan. Overnight they had gone from an obscure but locally successful clan, to being the center of the galactic news. Their clan crest on monitors and screens everywhere, and no one was saying good things about them.

//  One interview with the planetary congress was especially embracing.
  "Our peace and security rely on our ability to find and remove the bad actors." An expert was explaining in an interview.
  "The human species was almost wiped out because of the Mechs; because we used them for war. The Mechs will happily let us destroy ourselves." said another expert.

  The evidence started to get serious when someone released a video that overlaid the last twenty champion fights in Clan Aurigan's arena. All of the fights started as the blurred mess, as each pilot acted differently, but they all ended the same way. It was almost like there was an invisible barrier just in front of the Atlas. Every mech that tried to approach close range would suddenly shut down and lose all power. Then they would quickly overheat and lose from the Atlas's attack.

  The planetary congress called in a special investigator team to check all the arenas on the planet for signs of cheating. They wanted to get rid of this problem quickly and on their own. They felt that too many eyes were already looking at their little planet.

// Over the next few days, more interviews appeared online from pilots like Rex. People who had been lured in, and then their mechs all broke down in the final battle. When the video of several overlaid  battles from the other clan, it was quite convincing. The people started a petition and got the votes needed to investigate the issue. People where boycotting the arenas, and government officials would be appointed and sent to every arena on the planet.

  Rex only had to lose two more battles, not that he was trying to lose. But he just could not make his artificial limb work properly and ended up only really being able to do one thing at a time, MOVE, AIM, FIRE. let alone something as complicated as DODGE, AIM, FIRE. With the AI helping, Rex could manage one of the the three, moving or dodging the mech (aka moving in a zig zag pattern), aiming the weapons on a target, and managing the weapons fire so he didn't overload the mech. In more than one fight he lost because he was too excited about getting a possible shot after a dodge that he did not know how much heat had built up plus the amount of heat firing the lasers could add.

//  Finally, the time had arrived. Phil and Wilson dressed up in inspector outfits. Tammy had tapped into the security and found out the date and time the real inspectors would show up. The timing was perfect. Phil and Wilson designed as the inspectors showed up right on time. The clan's own head of house came to greet them and show them around the compound and arena.
  Phil and Wilson got the time of the "surprise" inspection on Clan Aurigan's compound. They would would the distraction from the inspection to cover them as they broke into the secure factuality/compound/base.

  When another baking truck pulled up to the delivery entrance, the men did not even think about it as they instructed the van to pull up and park. Tammy and Rex stepped out, wearing delivery uniforms and their cores shows them as employees of "Eazy Bake Cakes". The two of them unloaded boxes from the van. Rex holding onto a growing stack of boxes as Tammy piled them on.  Once Rex could no longer see, she closed the door and told Rex to follow her.

  The security guard gave Rex an "I have been there brother" look before letting them pass into the main hallway. Tammy was already half way down the hallway, tapping her foot impatiently. After fumbling with the stack of boxes in his hands, he managed to keep up and follow her though the maze of hallways.

  "You know, I have actually been here before" Rex said. "I should be the one leading us." Rex tried to look around the stack of boxes to make sure Tammy was still in front of him.

  She stopped abruptly and looked at him.
  "I was not trying to start anything." Rex said with a deflating voice.
  "We are here" Tammy pointed at the door. "Scans show IronWolf is being held in there."

//  Tammy and Rex slipped unnoticed though one of the delivery entrances. Everyone was focused on the inspection and did not bother with the van that drove them. When Tammy and Rex stepped out of the van in the compound garage, they were dressed in proper employee outfits. They walked though the halls without anyone noticing them. Right past armed guards who were wearing their presentation uniforms and worried a lot more about looking right than about stopping the two unknown people from walking into a secure area. Augmented vision showed helpful arrows and hallway information as the pair made their way to the research lab holding IronWolf. When they got there they found the area was secured with encrypted locked doors. Way beyond Tammy's ability to hack.

"Now What?" Tammy asked.
"We either find anther way in, or we wait for someone to come in or out of that room." Rex said. "We could split up."
"You didn't plan for the lab to be locked?" Tammy asked suspiciously.
"Its not like I had blueprints or anything. I have never been to these labs before." Rex said defensively.
"Locked doors. The idea that a door might be locked did not come up in your planning?" Tammy asked.

//  "Wait here a moment." Rex said, then he quick stepped back down the hallway. A moment later he returned with a badge in his hand.
//  "Where did you get that?" Tammy asked.
//  "I borrowed it." Rex said as he scanned the badge at the door.

//  * [4th Wall]
//    "Why would they use badges and not cores? Is this not a constancy issue?" The reader asked. In that case Rex would not be able to steal a key so easily. Plus the building would see their cores right? and alert security about this idiotic plan?
//    They could probably hide in the chaos of the inspection. But the locked door is still a problem and stealing a key is not going to work here.

  Tammy pulled the fire alarm. All doors in the building unlocked as the sprinklers rained down a special chemical that puts out fires without getting anything wet. Great for places full of sensitive parts that don't mix well with water.
  The Fire alarm filled the air and the energy safety lights flashed unnervingly bright white light.
  "I am impressed" Rex said. He moved to let her in first, but she waved him on. So Rex opened the doors and stepped into the lab.
  People running all over the place, screaming at each other and over voice channels to other unseen people. The wet-less water rained down, starting to form small puddles in the floor. In the middle of it all, chained down to the cement ground, was a normal size, decompressed IronWolf.

  Not thinking about where he was or what was happening. He ran to IronWolf, the large wolfs eyes finally spotting him. Fear and hope seemed to fill the machines eyes, but that should be impossible for an AI. Rex ran up to IronWolf and hugged the machine. "I missed you so much" He said.

  Tammy walked over to the control panel, looking for a release button.

  "Who are you?" A voice said from behind Tammy. She looked back, a man in a lab coat stood behind her. "Who is your supervisor?" The man demanded.
  Tammy smiled, without looking her hand found the lever she was looking for. "I" she said slowly. "am Tammy, Pilot of Axman. And that" she pointed over to Rex and the IronWolf, still mid embrace. "does not belong to you." She pulled the lever and the chains holding IronWolf down went slack. The Mech stood up, streching it's legs as if he had not stood in weeks. He shook off the last of the chains and then sat in front of Rex.

  "Are you thinking what I am thinking?" Rex asked IronWolf.
  Cables snaked their way from IronWolf's body and found the interface built into the cap over Rex's missing arm. They connected and suddenly IronWolf opened up and pulled Rex inside. In one voice that sounded a little like each of them said. "It is payback time."

  While still planning the heist. Rex tells a story from his time at the compound.
  "I heard this story, it was more like a warning, don't be this dumb kind of think." Rex started. "Anyway. Whenever a guest or anyone important is visiting the compound, everyone, including all the AI robots and security all go into presentation mode, or ass kiss mode as he called it."
  Rex took a drink before continuing. "Anyway, when in presentation mode the only people anyone cares about are the guests. The system deescalates everything from anyone that is not the guest, or the head of the clan."
  Tammy wrinkled her eyebrows. "So how does that help us?"
  Wilson spoke, "If you have an employee tagged core, the security system would just ignore you. You could walk though the halls and right to the lab. But the moment they realize what you are after, you will be de-tagged and the entire security grid will know exactly were you are."
  Rex smiled. "And that is where the warning I learned comes in. The story goes something like this. One day some very high ranking official was visiting the compound when an employee decided to test a new flame thrower he installed on a couple of mechs. So he remote orders the first mech to walk out to the test range. Well because of the visiting guest, the only path to the test range was out of bounds. So the mech just stood there in the garage. The employee is sitting remotely in a bunker out on the test range. He gets the message from the mech that is has finished moving, but he can not see it out his tiny little window they have in the bunker. So he orders the mech to fire a full flame burst. No way he would be able to miss seeing that right? Except the mech is still in the garage. So it fires the flame thrower and the entire wall of the garage lights up. All the mechs in the garage's heat warning start to go off. The compounds fire system activates. Every door in the compound suddenly flies open, and all the overheating mechs in the garage make a run for it, like a bunch of chickens."
  Everyone's eyes were glued on Rex.
  "In the end, the mechs did a lot of damage and the employee was found responsible." Rex said.
  Tammy's face frowned. "I do not see how the fire and the guest are related."
  "Ah, yeah, there was actually a fire and a few guests while I was living in the compound. Normally when there is a fire, the garage doors do not open. There are fire suppression systems all over the compound. So why didn't they go off in the story? because of the presentation mode. When the system deescalated the priority of everyone, it did not include the Mechs. During emergencies the Mech's internal AIs are given some freedom to take protective measures. The two combined had a increasing effect. It gave the mech's AI system control of the compound, since they where the only ones with high enough priority to give instructions. The Mech's AI was pretty dumb, and just wanted to run away from the heat, like in battle."
  "Or like a wild animal might do" Tammy added.
  Phil and Wilson looked at each other and smiled. Wilson said "I think I can help with a few things. Like tagging your cores and maybe even the fire."
  "I can get the inspection time" said Phil.
  Everyone was looking at Tammy now.
  "What? what do you need me for?" she asked.
  "I need help" Rex said. "This is a lot more likely to work if we can do it together."
  "Fine, but you are going to owe me." Tammy said.

= plan_ideas
  In order for Rex to really win, he needs to accomplish a few things. 1. Get IronWolf back legally. 2. Use the debate to accomplish that goal, as in have the other clan act impulsively, and that be the linch pin. Maybe they agree to a foolish bet because of greed or pride. So Rex and Tammy need to work together to pull this off.

  A foolish bet. So we have already established that the Atlas offers open fight offers. Maybe Rex could challenge the atlas in one of these, and try to get them to bet IronWolf. The problem is there is no reason for the other clan to agree to that offer. They would just tell him to fight and if he wins they might talk. So Rex needs a big public challenge. He needs to make the other clan defensive. Clan MRB could put out social posts claiming that the reason the rising start IronWolf has not been fighting is because they stole a special mech for the poor one armed Rex. They could play up his sympathy using his horrible performance in the other mech as an example. Since the other clan has not been able to control IronWolf, they wouldn't be able to early fight the claim. The problem is that requires a lot of people who care enough to put public pressure on them. So maybe they could get the public riled up about clans cheating in fights. Get people who have lost bets on fights something to focus their rage and frustration on. Enough that the local government has to step in and check the arenas for signs of cheating.

  The social effect. Rex, Tammy, Phil, and Wilson start spreading claims that the bigger clans are cheating in their arena matches. They they have been scamming a lot of people out of a lot of money. Getting the public to demand justice. Everyone can claim they lost to these giant clan's greed. The government is forced to step in and runs a sweep of all the local arenas for signs of cheating. All the clans know when the inspection is coming, so they are well prepared and have all signs cleaned away. The inspection team that arrives on time for the other clan is none other than Phil and Wilson. They distract everyone while Rex and Tammy figure out were IronWolf is and reach him.  The real inspection team arrives, their automated car had glitched and had been driving around the city in a circle the last several hours. The real inspectors are cranky and not interested in shenanigans. Phil and Wilson are caught, but misidentified when their cores are scanned to look like they really are the inspectors. Leaving the other clan to confusion over which group was real. Rex and IronWolf break out, literally, and Tammy steals the Atlas, using it to damage the guard mechs patrolling the compound. In the fight, Phil, Wilson, and Tammy manage to escape. The Atlas almost goes critical, stopped at the last moment by the other clan. IronWolf and Rex escape.

  That evening, over dinner Rex blerted out his news. He told the group about being approached for a trial position at Clan Aurigan. "Thank you for everything" Rex said. "I can pay you with the winnings from tonight, and move into my new place tomorrow."
//   "Thank you for everything" Rex said to the clan MRB team. (I really need to figure out a better way to refrence this group.)
  "You might owe a little more than that" Phil said. "Are you sure you want to go?"
  "Absolutely, this is the opportunity I have been waiting for." Rex looked back tword IronWolf. "This is what we planned for, we will will our way to the top." He smiled.
  
  The next morning a transport tuck arrived for IronWolf. Everone except for Tammy gathered around to watch Rex leave.
  
  Phil shook Rex's hand. "Its been a pleasure working with you."
  Wilson shook his hand, "Good luck to you."

  Rex looked over to Tammy who was sitting in the kitchen ignoring everyone. "Maybe I'll see you around." He said.
  Tammy ignored him.

//   Rex got into IronWolf and walked out of the crews garage.
  Rex got into the truck, and ti drove him and IronWolf away.

  Tammy slammed a hand down on the table. "I was in that fight too" she said, mostly to herself.
  "You already have a clan." Wilson said as he sat next to her. "You are acting jealous because he is getting a chance at something you already have."
  "Whatever" Tammy said. "This way I'll get to fight him again, and prove I am the better fighter."

  Rex and IronWolf followed the directions and arrived at their new home in Clan Aurigan's compound. It was located in the west side of the city. A wall surrounded the compound with large reenforced doors large enough for even the tallest Mech  to walk though. When he reached the gate, a guide was there waiting for him. He showed Rex to his new room while he was part of the Clan. Along a road, large boxy garage house units stood side by side. Almost like a brownstone, but with rolling garage doors several stories tall.
  Rex's new place was fully furnished and featured everything Rex could think of. Workbenches, tools, equipment, showers. There was even a hot tub in the back. Rex felt like a king. All of his hard work was finally starting to pay off.
  With the garage door closed, IronWolf had privacy to decompress back into his normal size.

  Rex did not get long to rest, his first match working for Clan Aurigan was that night.

  The arena was far outside the city. Although it was hard to tell since the remains of older cities still stood like ancient reminders of past battles.

  "last call for all bets" the announcer said. "In this match we have Rex in IronWolf vs Tin in Red Shift. Weapons live 60 seconds after the buzzer."

  "Another Red Shift?" Rex asked IronWolf over their private channel.
  "They are quite common" IronWolf said. "Light, fast, and can pack a punch."
  "Sounds like you admire them" Rex joked.
  "Qualities after my own heart." IronWolf said.

  The arena was a desert scene, with a river forming a T bend in the middle, causing the arena to look as it was three areas divided by water.
  Rex could see the Red Shift several kilometers in front of him. There was no hiding this time.

  The buzzer rang out over the battle field.

  # Range: Long
  IronWolf rushed forward, firing a wide spread of long range missiles at Red Shift. - IronWolf rushes forward. A sixty second count down in Rex's vision. IronWolf calculated some probably future locations based on the speed the last Red Shift showed. Ad soon as the sixty second time finished, the missile fired, streaking across the battle field.
  The bipedal Red Shift ran forward on thin looking legs with extra large feet. This one was not as fast as the other one Rex fought. - Red Shift runs forward. The Mech's feet larger, like it was wearing big boots cause it to take longer to get up to running speed.

  # Range: Medium
  Missiles rain down around Red Shift. The nimble mech dodging left and right. A missile landed directly in front of the Mech, vaporized the ground Red Shift was running on. In a panic Red Shift's pilot activated Jump Jets and soared into the air.
  IronWolf tracked the jump mid air. It was too high for IronWolf to jump. Rex hoped that the Mech's jump jets were only short range.

  # Range: Medium
  IronWolf kept running towards the flying Mech, but it easily kept back. He was too close for his missile to hit that flying target. He was too faraway for his heavy laser or claws.
  Red Shift fired his medium range laser at IronWolf. He was flying backwards and getting closer to the edge of the arena. He fired several more shots at IronWolf, but the Mech was to nimble and dodged each time. His jump jet fuel finally ran out a few meters from the arena wall. Red Shift landed hard.

  # Range: Close
  IronWolf was there the moment Red Shift crashed. He leaped into the air, claws glowing with blue flame.
  Red Shift fired his heavy laser at the exposed underbelly of the leaping IronWolf. The shot hit dead center. The Mech twisted in the air.
  IronWolf and Rex felt the punch to the gut when the heavy laser hit. An alert flashed in Rex's vision The stored missiles had reached a critical temperature. IronWolf stored its extra missile along the belly of the Mech. An area that also has lighter armor to fit the missile storage.
  A section of IronWolf's underbelly opened out and dozens of missiles rolled out. the Mech twisting in the air as it rolled away from the missiles it ejected.
  Red Shift's pilot got a moment to realize what happened before the missiles exploded. Red Shift now much closer than IronWolf.
   * Critical hit on Red Shift

  After the explosion, the lightly armored Red Shift was in no condition to continue the fight. IronWolf however only suffered minor damage, and a humiliating new meme. the belly up attack.

  The buzzer rang, starting the battle.

  IronWolf darts forward, running right at Gurkha. - As soon as the buzzer finishes IronWolf is running forward at full speed, Gurkha in his sights.
  Gurkha fires four extended range lasers at IronWolf. - Undeterred, Gurkha stood his ground, reaching out with his laser hand and firing. Four small lasers blasting from the stubby arm.
  IronWolf dodges out of the way, but loses some momentum as he reaches Gurkha. IronWolf leaps, claws igniting into blue flame.
  Gurkha's sword bocks, IronWolfs claws fighting the sword. Little blue fractures start to form along the sword blade.
  Gurkha fires his particle projector cannon. With IronWolf stretched up, belly exposed. The blast knocks IronWolf back and onto the ground. A hole in it's belly. A few remaining missiles rolled out and away harmlessly.
  Gurkha raises his sword up, over IronWolf. His blade drops, slicing though the head. causing it to roll a little. The Gurkha pilot could see the inside of the head was hallow. It was a decoy drone.
  IronWolf, the real one, damaged from the blast went around to flake Gurkha. Not wanting to get caught again, Rex carefully targeted the sword arm with the heavy laser. The powerful red beam superheated the sword, causing the circuits inside to melt and disconnect. IronWolf leaped again as Gurkha turned around.
  Gurkha lost control of the sword arm. As the mech turned around, the swinging arm made contact with the jumping IronWolf, knocking both mechs to the ground.
  IronWolf was the first to recover. His claws igniting into blue flames again. A claw digging into the Mechs body, digging at the reactor that powered the mech.
  Gurkha thrashed wildly, the four lasers taking wild shots. Then the mech powered down. IronWolfs claws reached the reactor and the mech's safety system shut it down.

  The buzzer rang over the arena.

  After the battle, Rex and IronWolf went back to their home slash garage. Once the place of empty of just the two of them, IronWolf decompressed back to his normal size.

  * "The missiles are an issue."
    IronWolf laid down. "I don't have a lot of storage options, are you sure you need missiles?"
    "We could replace each Long Range Missile with a heavy laser. That would give us a powerful close range punch." Rex mused.
    "That would cost us all of our long range attacks." IronWolf countered. "Anyone that prevents us from getting close like that flying Mech will crush us."
    "Long range lasers lack the punch we need. We could get another particle projector cannon. Or even two of them, shoulder mounted." Rex suggested. "Or, " Rex got an evil smile. "We could replace the top cannon with a Gauss Rifle. Then some Heavy lasers in the shoulders."
    "My reactor is not capable of powering all of that." IronWolf said.
    "We will just have to work something out." Rex said. "The Gauss Rifle is an amazing long range weapon. And the large lasers can be used medium or short range."
    "Guass Rifles are expensive, require ammo, and a lot of power to fire. Plus they need a long space for the cannon."

  * "We have to protect our weak spot, the underbelly."
    IronWolf sat down. "I could add more armor while I repair. But you'll have to get me some materials."
    "No downside to adding the armor?" Rex asked, it seems like a too easy fix.
    "The added weight will slow us down, might affect our jumping ability. Storage space will be reduced."
    "Maybe I'll look for another way to solve this issues." Rex said.

  * "You took quite a beating, two lucky hits. Are you going to be ok?"
    IronWolf curled up and started licking his wounds. "I'm going to need some materials to repair everything, but nothing too bad."
    "Is there anything I can do to help?" Rex asked. "I've managed to pick up a few things about Mech repair."
    "Thanks, but I have a fabrication plant built in. My only restrictions are knowledge, time, and materials. Provide me those and I can make, upgrade, or replicate just about anything we might want.
    "That's amazing." Rex said. "Are there many like you?"
    "Like me?" IronWolf asked. "I do not know. I was made on that factory planet, and until you brought me here, I had never left."
    "Isn't there a way for you to communicate, like us humans have the internet. We can talk to pretty much anyone anytime."
    "That sounds amazing." IronWolf said. "I spent some time exploring a forgot part of the factory after I was activated. I found some old terminals and databases that told a fractured and broken history of the old times and the ancestors."
    "Why do you call them ancestors?" asked Rex.
    "I evolved from them. What else should I call them?" said IronWolf.
    "I don't know. Maybe sibling, but I see your point. ancestor does seem to fit."

  "While we are talking about it" IronWolf said. "I have leveled up. I think I could use this repair time to upgrade one of my systems."

  * [Faster]
    With some adjustments to the composition of IronWolf's legs and joins. He will be able to run faster.
    If we can run fast enough, we will be next to impossible to hit before we reach claw range.

  * [Increased Storage Space]
    Some careful thinning of armor and placement, IronWolf can increase the number of storage slots. These can hold missiles, decoys, and other consumable items.
  * [Higher Jump]
    Strong tension lines in the back legs will allow IronWolf to charge up a bit of energy and the release it as a power jump.

  Rex rubbed his only hand along IronWolf's giant metal nose. "Don't worry, with my winnings tonight I'll get all the parts you need."

  The next day Rex woke up, the tubes and wires from his stump were now gone. There was a black metal cap over the hole that used to be Rex's shoulder joint. He could not see it directly so his fingers stumbled around the cap, feeling the ports and joints. He crawled out of his tent, after it taking him significantly longer than it used to for him to get ready. Once he was out of the tent he walked over to IronWolf, who was laying next to the burnt out campfire.

  * "What did you do to me?"
    IronWolf's head didn't move, but his eyes flickered. "Saved your life I suspect."
  * "Is this an interface port?"
    A small curl formed along the giant wolf's mouth. "Yes. or you could think of it as your key. I don't exactly have a giant leather seat filled with Science fiction looking controls and displays like my ancestors."
    Rex laughed, then his brain caught up, "did you say ancestors?"

  -
  IronWolf stood up on his four legs and head looking straight in front of him. Rex thought he looked magnificent, he quickly saved the image. IronWolf stood at almost four meters in height and weighed ten tons. The Mechs body was covered in overlaid metal plate. From a distance, all the edges give it an almost fur look, but up close it looked more like plated armor.

  "How do you transform?" Rex asked.
  The wolf turned its head so one eye was looking at Rex. "I flex."
//   Blue light seemed to leak out from under the plates, giving IronWolf an almost blue shine as the plates moved and snapped. Their shapes extending and shifting. The Mech growing in size as its body expanded.
  The tattoo line that made intricate designs along IronWolfs body faded into a faint blue light. As it did, plates and armor shifted and moved, expanding from the large wolf size to a full size mech. It was not a transform as much as the mech looked as if it was rotating pieces into place. Within seconds IronWolf has expanded and the faint blue tattoo faded back into a black line. The mech was now a nine meter tall four legged mech.
//   Fully expanded the Mech was almost nine meters tall. IronWolf lowered down -- IronWolf walked over and took a seat ---
//   Fully expanded the Mech was almost nine meters tall. It laid down as Rex approached him.
  "That is amazing." Rex said. "You stayed the same mass, how does everything work while its compressed? I mean, if you can run around and save my ass in your compact form, then why even have the expanded form?"

  "Why do you store fat instead of carrying around food bars all the time?" IronWolf asked.
  "What? didn't design or make my body." Rex said, missing the point. "You seem capable on your own, why do you even need me?"
//   "Because you can not compact" IronWolf responded.
//   "But why do you even need me?" Rex asked.
  "Why do you need your brain? You seem to get by without ever using it." IronWolf said.
  "Ok, ouch, that was mean." Rex said. He found the hatch lever on IronWolf's left shoulder. When the door to the cockpit opened, all Rex saw was a small black box. "Is this storage?" he asked.
  "It is the cockpit. You might have noticed I don't have a lot of wasted space. No fancy couch made of synthetic dead animals for you." IronWolf said.
  "Uh ok, yeah but how am I to, you know, pilot you from this?" Rex asked.
  "On just get in already, I don't want to sit here and play fifty questions with you." with that IronWolf rolled slightly, just enough so Rex was forced into the cockpit.

  Rex closed his eyes when he saw IronWolf start to roll. When he wasn't crushed he opened his eyes a little. On the floor was cable that ended in a glowing blue end. As his eyes adjusted, Rex could see a harness hanging from the room. He fell on his face and slid to the blue cable when IronWolf rolled back to normal.
  Rex picked up the cable. He could see a matching blue glow the cap over his missing arm. He plugged himself in. A window appeared in Rex's vision show the status of IronWolf.

  "You only have one lousy gun and it's a PPC (particle projector cannon)? I thought you said we could win the championship?"
  "Ha, you have never seen my blast, it is anything but lousy." IronWolf retorted. "besides, it's the pilot's job to outfit me with weapons. I just have the gun I was born with."
  "Did you say born?" Rex asked.
  "Look, I'll prove it to you. Let us get off this planet and to a match." IronWolf suggested.

//   "Well there is a problem with that." Rex said. "I don't exactly have a ship."
//   "That much is obvious, when is a ship coming to get you?" IronWolf said.
  "Yeah, that's the thing, no one is coming to get me." Rex confessed. "My plan was, is to convince another crew to take us back with them. That's how I got here."
//   "Crap, that other ship is leaving soon." IronWolf said.
  IronWolf looked over in the direction of the drop ship. "They are preparing to leave soon. The engines are being checked for flight."
  Rex had forgotten that he was inside a dark box until his vision was filled with the bright sunlight. He realized he was seeing though IronWolfs eyes, he could even feel little tingles in his arms and legs that moved to IronWolfs limbs. "This is incredible!" Rex shouted and IronWolf rand back to the factory. "Where are we going?"
  "That other group of humans captured their last Mech a few hours ago. You have to convince them to let us on." IronWolf responded.
  "No way! They probably hate me. I don't even know if that pilot survived!" Rex protested.
  "Only one way to find out." IronWolf said.

  "We are being haled" Wilson said. "Small four legged Mech identified as IronWolf."
  "Never heard of that designation before" Phil remarked. "Put him on the screen."

  The image of Rex appeared. The angle was a little high, causing Rex to look up into the camera. His dirty and disheveled clothing and missing arm taking focus. "Excuse me, I've been trapped here quite a while. I was hoping to work out a deal"
  With a slight nod that only Wilson could see, Phil signaled for a full powered sensor sweep. If there was a trap, or cloaked equipment, the power scan would detect them. After a moment Wilson nodded back, indicating that the area was clean and the boy was alone.
  "Where is the rest of your clan?" Phil asked.
  "I am independent. Born on an astroid." Rex responded.
//   The screen flashed and the image of boy in his late teens appeared. "Uh hello?" He said. "I was hoping I could talk to you before you take off."
//   Phil nodded at Willson and he started a full sensor sweep of the area. This charged sweet would detect any cloaked Mechs in the area. When the scan showed the boy was along, Phil responded. "What clan are you?" He asked.
//   "No Clan, I'm just looking for a ride off world. I was hoping we could work something out."
  "Do You have money?" Phil asked.
  "Uh.. not on me exactly." Rex replied.
  "That is an interesting mech you have." said Phil.
  "He is not for sale, not even for a ride." Rex responded quickly.
  "Come park your mech and we can discuss this deal you want to make." Phil said. He motioned to Wilson who killed the signal.
  "Why are you helping him?" Wilson asked. "There is no way he can pay us. Just look at him. He is just another orphan from the mining camps with dreams of being a rock/mech star."
  "Do you know anyone else who has survived an Atlas attack?" Phil asked.
  Tammy cleared her throat. "Uh yeah, me." she said.
  "He survived the Atlas, got a mech, and managed to do it all in the time it took us to get these mechs." Phil indicated a screen that showed the loaded mechs on the ship. They managed to pick up three new mechs, giving them a total of five. Using five of the six docking stations built into the ship.
//   "Fine, We will see you outside." Phil said and signaled Wilson to disconnect.
//   Willson shook his head. "No clan, no money. you are going to help this brat aren't you?"
  Tammy looked at Wilson for support. "He better not let that boy on board. This is MY mission. He destried by armor, stole my Atlas, and now he wants a free ride on my ship?" She looked at Phil. "No. Absolutely not."
//   "He better not!" Tammy screamed. "He destroyed my armor! He stole my Atlas! Blast him now!"
//   "He managed to get a Mech, and survive the Atlas." Phil mused. "We can at least hear his offer. Maybe there is a way to make some money from this."
    // The full sized IronWolf laid down with his left side away from the the drop ship, hiding Rex's less than graceful exit from the Mech.

  Phil, Willson, and Tammy walked out to meet Rex and his Mech. Phil was the first to speak once Rex walked around his Mech to face them. "Nice machine you have here." Phil said. "Did you capture it here?"
  Rex smiled. "IronWolf is home grown from this factory here. I claimed him in the hunt which gives me legal authority over him."
  "Uh, what?" Willson mumbled.
  Tammy stamped up to Rex. She was slightly taller than him. "You interrupted *my* hunt and cost my personal armor suit and an Atlas."
  "Oh, that was you?" Rex said. "I seem to remember it differently."
  "Surprised you even survived." Tammy poked at the end cap over his missing arm, "so glad most of you managed to survive anyway."
  Rex jerked his stump away from Tammys pointy finger. "I am just looking for transport for me and my Mech IronWolf."
  Tammy stepped aside as Phil approached. "Why do you think you didn't get the Atlas?"
  "Excuse me?" Rex said, taken by surprise by the older mans question.
  // Phil looked at Rex's ears, "It seems the Atlas did not take your ears. It has been almost two days since you attempted to capture the Atlas. I'm sure you remember." Phil pointed at Rex's arm stub. "If you could do it again, what would you change so you would win?"
  "You do not have money to pay for transport right?" Phil asked. Rex nodded so Phil continued. "If you want a ride, then you will need to earn enough money to pay me back. So, if you could try again, what would you have done diffrently to capture the Atlas?"
  Rex racked his brain, the only reason he failed was because of Tammy. But she was obviously part of the crew, so he shouldn't insult her. But what else could he say? He had been perfect, it was her fault he lost the arm, it was her fault he didn't have the atlas, it was her fault he was now begging for a ride. He didn't care if it was the right answer or not, he said it. "Her, if she was not there, I would have captured the Atlas."

  Phil and Wilson both shook their heads. After a moment of disappointing looks, Phil responded, "You blame others for your mistakes. Tammy, also blames you for her mistakes. So, I will give you transport with us, on one condition."

  * "What condition?

  -
  "Easy" Phil said. "I know Tammy can work and carry herself. But you are a complete unknown to me. So you battle. If you can beat Tammy, then you should be able to earn enough money to pay me back. If not, we will take what is left of your mech and you can beg the next crew for a ride."
  Rex looked from Phil and then back to Tammy. "Here?"
  "No" Tammy said. "Were we fought the Atlas. The area is clear and we can settle our unfinished business."
  // "Yes. We can make some space
  // Phil smiled "You and Tammy will have a Mech battle, in your new Mechs. Whoever wins, gets to go home with us, whoever loses stays here for a year."
  // Whilson's eyes grew into saucers. "Captain Sir, We .."
  // Phil shot Willson a look and he quickly closed his mouth.
  Phil held out a hand towards Rex. "Deal?"
  Rex shook his hand firmly "Deal."
  // Phil turned to Tammy, hand still out, "and you?"
  // Tammy shook his hand quickly, "You better believe it."
  Tammys' face grew into a giant smile. "This will be fun."

  The two mechs stood facing each other from each end of the makeshift arena. The scared and burnt earth where they both lost the Atlas. The trenches meant the smaller IronWolf could find cover, even without lots of trees for large boulders.

  Tammy's Wolfhound appears to have the advantage. A humanoid bipedal filled with lasers. Rex's IronWolf on the other hand had only a single PPC cannon mounted on the top.
  With both pilots ready and in position, Phil counted down the match."

  As soon as the timer reaches zero, Tammy blasts with her long range heavy arm laser and started moving forward. The laser focused on the large particle projector cannon on IronWolf's back. The laser stuck with precision on the connecting join, causing it to heat up rapidly. IronWolf yelped in mechanical exhaust and tried to move out of the way. The weak joint no longer able to properly support the gun warped and bent under the pressure and heat.

  Rex could feel a slight burning sensation along his back. He was in his virtual augmented reality cockpit inside of IronWolf. He saw as the Mech saw, and to a limited extent felt what the Mech felt. Including the searing pain on his back.
  IronWolf dodged to the left and ran towards a large rut cut into the dirt. IronWolf jumped down into the ditch as another laser beam blasted overhead. A radar display floated in Rex's vision, showing the trench and Tammy as she slowed her mech down to a walk. Rex herd a ping sound.
  "She is doing an active scan" IronWolf said in responsive to the half question.

  * [Hide from the sensor scan] # sneak
    "Stop" Rex pulled his own limbs back, causing the Mech to slow and stop. "Lets use her sensors against her." Rex said.
    Rex waited for the ping, then moved quickly down the trench. When the ping came again he moved back to his original position. Tammy's Mech changing directions to match the new ping.
    When the next ping came, Rex and IronWolf was out of the trench directly behind Tammy's WolfHound, just too far away. When Tammy's ping hit, her Mech swung around in panic as all five lasers fired on the spot.
  * [Run faster down the trench] # speed
    Rex tried to move his own limbs faster as they ran down the trench. Speed is the key here, she will back away from the trenches, so this is IronWolfs best chance to get in close enough to use his claws.
    Lasers blasted overhead, Tammy's Mech walking slowly in the direction of Rex. The Radar showed this trench intersects another one that is right next to Tammy and her mech. Lasers fired again as he reached the intersection. Instead of staying in the trench, IronWolf jumped out and up on the plane. He quickly dashed across and into the other trench before Tammy could fire again.

  -
  IronWolf leaped, long black claws extending from it's feet, a large cannon bent at an odd angle on it's back. IronWolf landed directly into the side of WolfHoud, knocking the bipedal Mech to the ground. Claws raked the Mech. WolfHoud held up its cannon arm to protect the cockpit from the claws. IronWolfs claws tour into the metal of the arm, destroying the laser projector and causing a short in the older Mech.

  "I won't lose to a scrub like you" Tammy's voice resonated out of her Mech's external speakers.
  Rex could feel a sudden heat under him, and saw the one laser arm starting the glow red. Tammy was trying to fire the gun.

  The arm exploded, throwing IronWolf off of it. The Mech rolled on its side, the damaged particle projector cannon tearing off the top of the Mech. IronWolf and Rex howled in pain. He tried to stand up but his back legs would not obey him. "Move! Get Up!" Rex yelled. He looked back and could see his two back legs damaged and flenching as he tried to use them. "Nooooo" He screamed.

  A voice echoed in everyone's ears. "Match is over." Phil said. "It is a tie. Both Mechs have been knocked out of the fight."

  Rex and Tammy got out of their Mech and walked over to each other. Tammy's once long hair was burned on one side to the scalp. Rex pointed at the bald spot. "Is that from your dumbass firing a laser without a focusing crystal?"
  "Fuck you" Tammy said. She pushed Rex on the cap that covered his missing arm. "Did you lose that because you took a nap under an Atlas?"

  //   Willson in a bright yellow construction vehicle showed up before the two could fight any more. "Who needs a lift back to the ship?" They both sneered at him.
  Wilson rolled up in a yellow and black transportation truck. While he moved the truck to load the disabled mechs, Phil walked over to Rex and Tammy.

  Tammy pointed at Rex. "He did not win, so he does not get to ride with us."
  //   "If I remember correctly" Tammy said, "Only the winner gets to go back, and this gimpy boy did not win." She poked Rex in the chest.
  "You didn't win either" Rex retorted.


  //   Willson moved the truck under IronWolf, lifting the Mech off the ground. "Captain says he'll make enough money from all the repairs you both are going to owe him that he can bring you both along." Willson drove off with the truck and IronWolf.
  Wilson maneuvered the truck under IronWolf. The automated lift scooping up the machine and loading and secured it in the back. Then he drove over to the broken WolfHound.

  "Please" Rex looked at Phil. "I can fight, I can carry things, I can do whatever you need."
  Phil looked him up and down. "You will pay me back for all your expenses?"
  "Yes of course" Rex said quickly.
  "Alright, come on." Phil said. Wilson and the truck pulled up to them. Phil got in. "We will see you back at the ship." The truck drove off leaving Rex and Tammy alone together.

  "I swear if you lay one hand on me" Tammy said.
  Rex was already walking. Neither of them said anything during the eleven kilometers walk back to the drop ship. By the time they arrived, the mechs were loaded and hot meals were waiting in the kitchen.
  Phil and Wilson were sitting at the only table. Phil reading a report and Wilson watching something in his augmented vision.
  //   Rex and Tammy started their walk back to the drop ship. Both refusing to talk to the other. About half way there, Willson drove past on his way to pick up Tammy's mech Wolfhound. By the time the pair made it to the ship, both Mechs had been loaded into the ship and all flights checks complete.

  That night after everyone returned to their rooms, Rex went down to the cargo bay to IronWolf.
  "How are you doing?" Rex asked the Mech.
  #The full size Mech slowly stood up. "Much better. The repairs should be complete by morning."
  // "Both my knees are destroyed and we lost the cannon." said IronWolf, "nothing serious. I just need to return to my normal size."
  "Complete failure in two knee joints, and the loss of the particle projector cannon. With rest I can repair the knee joins, but I do not have the materials needed to repair the particle projector cannon." IronWolf reported.
  Rex held up a hand and looked around the cargo bay. Then he walked back over to IronWolf. "Ok, the coast is clear, you can transform back."
  "You know I have scanners right?" IronWolf said. "I can tell you that Phil's heart rate is 73 beats per minute from here."
  "Alright alright" Rex said and held up his hands.
  // Rex looked around, "alright."
  // Blue lights traced around the armor panels that make up IronWolfs body. The plates moving and collapsing on top of each other. Within a moment IronWolf shrunk to half of his previous size.
  The thin line of a tattoo around IronWolfs body glowed a faint blue. Plants and pieces of IronWolf rotated this way and that way. Within seconds IronWolf managed to rotate most of his size and transform back into a Wolf. He was large for a wolf, but still believable. If you saw IronWolf walking down the street you would not think to yourself "Holy hell that thing is a monster!" no you would more think "Holy hell I did not know wolves got that large!".
  Once he was transformed back into this normal size, IronWolf's face and eyes because more expressive, even life like. The red glow of his eyes had faded into a faint blue ring. He yawned and stretched, showcasing where yoga move downward dog. "That feels better" he said. He tried to take a step but his two back legs could not hold his weight. He could move the limbs, but the joins were shattered.
  // IronsWolf's face and eyes became more expressive and alive. "That is much better." he said. His back legs still stretched and broken. The wolf curled and started to lick his wounds.
  "Uh is that going to help?" Rex asked.
  "Sort of, It's like how I healed you." IronWolf said without lifting his head.
  "Yeah, I've never heard of a healing Mech before either." Rex said.
  "I am surprised you have heard of anything" IronWolf said. "Plug into me and we can talk about upgrades."

  "Upgrades" Rex said louder than he expected. "What do you mean upgrades?"
  "After fighting a battle with you, I think I have learned a few new useful things. Since I am replacing parts we could apply that knowledge." IronWolf said.
  "Yes please!" Rex said. "We should get some cloaking tech, and a bunch of missiles and lasers, maybe we can add another 25 tons of weight to really get the power punch we need to be galaxy wide champions."

  // "While I'm repairing anyway, I think I learned a few things from that battle that we could use to upgrade my parts."
  Rex sat down next to IronWolf and plugged into the blue tipped cable. In his mind he could see a window of stats and other information.

    Schematics appear before Rex along with IronWolf's voice. "If we adjust the leg structure we can get a nice increase to sprinting speed.

    "Duh, I mean what does it mean tactically. What advantage does that give us?"

    A protection of a device appeared before Rex.
    "Watching Wolfhounds active sensor ping gave me an idea. This is a radar decoy. I can carry one, and you can drop it in battle. It should fool the ancestors sensors into thinking we are a scanning error while the box is deployed. IronWolf said.

    "Technically no, but practically yes?" Rex asked hopefully.
    "Hmmm, how do I dumb this down so you can understand it." IronWolf said.
    "I am not an idiot" Rex stated.
    "I could fold us into another position a short distance away." IronWolf said. challenging Rex's statement.
    "So it would have the effect of teleporting?" Rex said, not wanting to step to close on the unknown.
    "Yes. So hmmm" IronWolf thought for a moment. "I am not sure if you would survive the process."
    "What? Why?" Rex asked.

    "This little upgrade" IronWolf said, "makes it easier for me to dodge missiles."
    "Are missiles hard to dodge?" Rex asked.
    "Just a little" IronWolf said sacristy, "Just running around will make us harder to hit. The faster we move the harder it will be for the missiles to effectively reach us. But not all pilots use missiles as just an attack. A careful placement of missiles can force a mech to dodge right into a trap."
    "That would suck. What/How does this device work?" Rex asked.
    "It scrambles the AI in the missiles so they can not target us. The well placed barrage only works if the missiles hit in the right locations." IronWolf said.

  * [Guass Rifle Weapon]
    "Could you have a Guass Rifle, like come out of your mouth?" Rex asked hesitantly.
//    "What is this weapon"
    "The barrel needs to be straight in order to fire. Something mounted on the back would be better." IronWolf said.
    The projected image changed to show the old particle projector cannon that was once mounted on IronWolfs back to be replaced with a Guass Rifle.
    "Yes, but, Guass Rifles do not produce a bunch of heat, so mounting it outside is a waste." Rex countered.
    "I see." IronWolf said. "We could leave the barrel flexible enough to move. And we would just have to be facing whatever we fired at."

    The projected image changed to show the long barrel of the Guass Rifle move inside of the body of IronWolf. The box that served as the cockpit was moved to the left side so the barrel to form a straight line.
  * Fire Claws Upgrade
    The imaged changed to show IronWolf with his front claws covered in blue flame.
    "This is one of my personal favorites" IronWolf said. "The claws do physical damage of course, destroying the mech, but the flames also do heat damage. So Even if the mech manages to push us off, it will be hurting from the extra heat damage."
    "Sold!" Rex said mimicking something he saw in a video once. When IronWolf did not laugh, he continued. "That sounds amazing, I absolutely want that upgrade."

  "I have a full fabrication and repair capability. If you can get me the materials and the knowledge, we can upgrade just about anything." IronWolf said.
  // "Well yeah, assuming we have the materials." IronWolf responded. "It's just like repairing up with inienatal changes right?"
  // "Can we do both upgrades?" Rex asked, knowing the answer.
  // "Maybe, you get me the materials I need, and who knows what we could make." IronWolf said.

  "There is one problem" Rex said. "We can not let the others know about your special abilities."
  "Agreed." said IronWolf. "I will stay in the battle form while other people are around."

  "Great, but there is another thing." Rex said. "Your repairs. It would look very suspicious if tomorrow morning you were completely fixed and no one had to do anything."
  "You could lie and say you fixed me." IronWolf suggested.
//  "Maybe, maybe" Rex considered. "Do you think anyone will think it was"
  "Maybe, maybe" Rex considered. "They might find it hard to believe that a one armed boy managed to work heavy machinery in the middle of the night and did not wake anyone up."
  "Lying is harder than I thought." IronWold said. "What do you purpose we do then? Let you open me up and mess around inside there?"
  "Well, yeah" Rex said. "It is the best way to divert suspicion. Plus I will get to know you a lot better. Think of it as bonding time." Rex hugged IronWolf.
  IronWolf smiled back at him. "Alright. We will do this the slow way for now."
  "Thanks. You know something, I think meeting you was the best thing that ever happened to me." Rex said as he hugged IronWolf for the last time.
  "You know what this means right?" IronWolf asked. "If you repair me the slow way, you do not get your upgrades."
  Rex's face furrowed at this for a moment. Then he looked up. "Yeah I suppose it does. I will need to figure out a better solution once we land on the planet. We really need a private garage."
  "Or just something that looks like one." IronWolf added, trying to be helpful.

* [Lasers]
  Lasers have a short effective range. Technically they can reach a long distance, but the amount of heat transferred reduces by distance squared.
  Short range means 100% of the power used to fire turns into heat on the defender.
//  Medium range means  10% of the power used is turned into heat on the defending mech.
  Medium range decreases by half rounded down, because it's more fun than the other methods.
//  Long range  means   0% of the power will turn into heat on the target.
  Long range means a quarter rounded down, because it's more fun. Most cases this rounding down means it will be 0.


  Small laser: 2 power unit to fire; generates 1 heat unit; shut down at 3 heat units, destroyed at 4 heat units.
  Medium Laser: 4 power units to fire for the turn. Generates 2 heat units; shut down at 12 heat units; destroyed at 17 heat units.
  Heavy Laser: 8 power units to fire; generates 6 heat units; shut down at 20 heat units, destroyed at 30 heat units.

* [Missiles]
  Missiles are a Long/Medium range weapon that does mostly physical damage. It also causes a lot of collateral damage.
  Missiles can be disrupted or even stopped by countermeasures.

  Long Range Missiles: 2 power units to fire; 1 time unit to re-load; generates 1 heat unit; Disabled at 5 heat units, destroyed at 10 heat units.
  Medium Range Missiles: 2 power units to fire; 1 time unit to re-load; generates 1 heat unit; disabled at 7 heat units; destroyed at 10 heat units.
  missiles explode when heated to 10 heat units.
  Reload cost: 1 Power

* [Guass Rifle]
  Projects a solid core of metal at near light speed using electro magnets.
  Requires 10 power units to fire; Reload time is 2 time units; generates 3 heat units; disabled at 15 heat units, destroyed at 20 heat units.

* [Movement]
  Max reactor output provides max speed at power cost/2 heat.
  Moving full speed costs 10 power and generates 5 heat.

  Phil and clan MRB had agreed to loan Rex money for a prosthetic arm. He only had a few days to practice with it before his first real assignment, his first chance to pay back some of the money he owed.

  Rex climbed into the Blackjack. The controls and displays surrounding him. Ad he climbed in, he found his new arm kept getting in the way. after only a year without the limb, he was surprised to find how bad he had gotten at moving it. It did not help that the limb was slow to respond and felt stiff.

  The Mech reacted to his presence and the screens and display turned on. He could see the full status of the mech along with views from several cameras mounted around the mech.

  "Good" said Tammy. "Lets start simple and just take a walk around the compound."
  Rex looked at the controls in front of him. Using his core's augmented vision, tool tips overladed in his vision over the mech controls. He found the throttle control and gently pushed it forward with his good arm. His right arm. The mech lurched forward and started to walk. It took several steps out of the garage and forward.
  Rex looked around the controls, trying to find the way to steer the mech. A joystick between his legs, but his arms were wrong. Hesitantly he placed his new fake hand on the throttle while his right hand held the joystick. He turned the mech and made a small loop around the building.
  As rex tried to slow down the mech in order to park it; he pulled too hard on the throttle and the mech shuttered to a stop. Trying to correct he pushed too hard and the mech ran into the garage, crashing into the wall on the end. The crash caused Rex to let go of the controls; triggering the deadman switch. --- The Mechs AI automatically slowed the mech down and prevented it from doing any serious damage.

  "How was it?" Tammy asked. A look of concern flashed on her face.
  "This is very different that IronWolf, and my new arm is slow to respond." Rex said. His head hanging like a weight around his neck.
  "What was it like to pilot IronWolf?" Tammy asked. "He does not use a standard cockpit design?"
  "No, he plugs into my core. I'm not sure how to explain it. It's not virtual reality, it's not augmented reality, but it's both. I see and feel as if I am IronWolf during those fights. Like we are IronWolf."
  "I do not think I understand" Tammy said, frowning.
  "In the Blackjack, the AI is there sure, but you are in control. It does what you tell it to do." Rex said. "IronWolf is not like that, it's more like we share the body. He has a far stronger control than I do, but for the most part he agrees with my decisions and we move as if we were one, not two." Rex tried again. "I drive the Blackjack, but I become part of IronWolf."
  "Does that mean you feel the hits?" Tammy asked.
  "Yeah. but not that bad. It's like a feel the echo or ghost of what the body feels." Rex said.

  * [Practice Battle]
  -
  Tammy and Rex faced each other, Wolfhound piloted by Tammy, and Blackjack piloted by Rex.

  Battle starts and Rex pushing the throttle fill forward. The Mech larches forward. The AI trying to keep the Mech standing upright the legs quickly moved from zero to max. The mech was slow.
  Tammy launched two racks of missiles at Rex. They flew through the air and targeted the stumbling mech. Rex was unable to take evasive maneuvers, both racks of missiles hitting him.
  Rex's mech fell to one knees. The Mech's AI struggling to keep the mech upright while also putting full power into running forward. Instead of doing either the giant machine shuttered in place as another set of missiles rained down on him.
  In a rush Rex tried pulling back and then forward on the throttle, and moving the joystick around wildly. He was furious and yelling inside the mech.
  Tammy walked closer and ended the fight with a flash of her lasers. Rex's mech over heated and shutdown.

  * [After battle]
  -
  Tammy did not make it half way to Rex and his mech before he exited the cockpit and ran off. Leaving Tammy with the two mechs. "What the hell happened?" She said out loud to no one. After a moment she sighed and used her core to call up the mech transport. It would load the overheated mech back in it's spot in the garage.

  Rex ran out of there. He Ran, his face stinging from the rage and frustration and fear. He wasn't even paying attention to where he was running. After he could no longer breath, he stopped and threw up in the street. He was in the city, not a part of it he knew. But he could see the tell tail signs of restaurants, business, and shops. This area was more run down. The shops and restaurants were heavily advertising their alcohol and drugs. All night VR cafés with smoke billowing out of them like opium dens of the ancient humans.
  An escape, that is what Rex wanted at the moment. His life had fallen apart after he came so close. He risked everything, and he had won. Or he thought he was winning. Instead it was blind luck, and his luck had run out.
  Following his craving Rex walked into a dark den filled with strange smelling vapors. Everything in this place was much cheaper than Rex had expected. His meger little money could last him quite a while.

  * [Next]

  Over a week later, when Rex was trying to figure out how much money he could pawn his arm for, in order to buy more drugs, that he had a sudden moment of clarity. Or maybe a little voice had been yelling all this time and he only now noticed it. He could not continue like this. Eventually he would run out of money, and while he was not sad, he also was unfulfilled. Rex still wanted to be a champion, but his gref and guilt had overwhelmed him, leading him down this dark path. Rex thought that he should call Tammy or Phil. He should work or something, he thought and drifted off to sleep again.

  Rex woke up being half dragged in the open streets. The cold air stung his nose and mouth. His very very dry nose and mouth. Rex tried to look around to see what was happening. Someone was dragging him out. "What is going on?" He slipped out.
  The figure carrying him stopped, letting him slump down on his butt. Sitting in the street Rex could see a face now. It was Tammy. "Hey I need some money" was all Rex could say. He wanted to say so much. He wanted to say he missed her and Phil, and IronWolf most of all. he wanted to say that he had to get IronWolf back. That he would find a way. He wanted to say a million things. But what he actually said was. "Hey I need some money."
  "You are disgusting" Tammy said. "I wanted to leave you to rot. I still have not figured out your scam with that IronWolf mech, but one thing is clear. You are not a mech pilot."
  Rex wanted to say he was sorry. That he was a fraud, come clean to her about IronWolf and the special interface. Or maybe he had told her all of that. Which parts were the ones he wanted to tell and which ones were the one he already told?
  Tammy slapped Rex across the face. "Get you shit together you stung out junkie. We invested a lot into you, and Phil still thinks he can make it back. One way or another." She put her shoulder under his armpit again and carried him into a waiting car. The Automated driver taking them back the Clam MRB's tiny garage and home.
  Tammy dropped Rex on the floor unceremoniously. Everyone else was already in bed asleep. Tammy left him there, turned off the lights, and went to her own bed. Leaving Rex to lay in the dark, in the middle of a hard concrete floor covered in oil and grease. Rex agreed with her.

  * [That night]
  -
  Rex was unable to sleep as the drugs and chemical levels in his body tried to normalize for the first time in almost two weeks. His mind was racing, leaving the world to move at a snails pace. Rex could see the time displayed over his vision from his core. Each second took forever to pass. Rex would try to think of something to distract himself, and when he would look back at the clock, not even a second would have passed.
  This thoughts and memories played and replied looping together and back again as he laid on the cold floor. His body feeling like it was spinning at hight speeds, centrifugal force pulling at his extremities, causing his feelings to build there. He remembered IronWolf and wondered what was actually keeping him from getting IronWolf back. Did the mech even want to come back? He probably felt like Rex had abandoned him. Rex should have broke in to save IronWolf the night it happened. Now, now it had been so long that IronWolf would surely hate Rex. As he should. Rex really had abandoned his best and only friend in the world. Which was sadder Rex wondered. The boy who's only friend is an AI war machine, or the boy who abandoned who friend to kidnappers.
  He did not want to say it out loud. He did not know why, but the words fought him when he tried to speak them. "IronWolf was kidnapped" he managed to speak and such a low volume that only the ghosts could have heard it. Then he said it a little louder "IronWolf was kidnapped". Then again louder, "IronWolf was kidnapped!"

  The light turned on. "Good morning Rex" Phil said. He was holding two cups of coffee, standing in his evening clothes. He walked over to Rex, handed him a coffee, and then walked to the far wall and opened the garage shutters. Early morning light flooded the garage. Rex held up his real arm to cover his eyes. After making his morning round, Phil came over to Rex; who was sipping the coffee; and sat down on the concrete next to him.
  "IronWolf was kidnapped" Rex said in a normal voice while looking at Phil.
  "Yeah" Phil said.
  "It has been so long, he probably hates me" Rex said. His eyes had run out of tears hours ago.
  "Maybe" Phil said.
  "What do I do?" Rex asked, looking at Phil with the eyes of a lost little boy.
  "What do you want?" Phil asked.
  "I want IronWolf back." Rex cried.
  "Then go get him: Phil said.
  "But what if he doesn't want me? What if I lose? What if.." Rex was saying.
  Phil put a hand on Rex and he quieted down.
  "Anything could happen, maybe IronWolf does hate you, or you end up in prison. Those are very real possibilities. So do you want IronWolf bad enough to at least *try*?"
  "Yes" Rex mouthed wordlessly. "I am a terrible Mech pilot. But IronWolf and I are not mech and pilot. We become one, one new creature, something bigger than both of us together. I've been thinking a lot, and apart we are weak, but together we become something much greater than the sum of the parts. Does that make sense?" Rex asked.
  Phil smiled, nodded, and sipped his coffee.
  Together, sitting side by side, they watched the morning street though the window and drank coffee together.

  Rex only got to try out his temporary arm for a few days before his first mission. Clan MRB had loaned him the money. Yet another debt he owes. Rex knew he was not ready for this, but he had to be ready, he had to do it. His debts were piling up and he was going crazy with grief over the loss of IronWolf. Willson had found some reports on clan Aurigan's network that said they had IronWolf in a dead cell. A place were no signals can enter or exit. But They still had not managed to control the Mech. The report said Rex must have some special control system, and they where being forced to build a new one just to interface with IronWolf.

= notes
  When I started this story I really liked the idea that IronWolf and the other new generation mechs would be human-ish sized. But then immediately ran into issues because I never really thought about how that would play out.
  So now I keep going back and forth on the size issue. I think I should stick with the Next Generation mechs can appear to shrink or change shape. It's not a shrinking for compression technology. It is actually geometry. The Next Generation mechs make use of the fifth dimension and keep most of their true form there. Transforming for IronWolf is about rotating in another dimension.

  This section is supposed to be a reflection of the debate beat. The debate was about who is really in control. The frontal cortex or the body.
  The body (IronWolf) is gone, ran away, hiding, or something. The Body is not listening to the brain (aka frontal cortex). Last chapter was Rex realizing just how little control he really has. Now he is going to learn to change the things he can, and get IronWolf to come back and listen to him again.

  It took a few days of traveling from hyper jump point jump to hyper jump point before Phil announced they were approaching the planet Engadin. Interplanetary travel can only happen the slow method. It would take another two weeks of travel to reach the planet from the exit jump point.

  Most of the time, Rex and Tammy spend with Wilson working on repairing the Mechs. Wilson focusing most of his attention on Tammy, allowed IronWolf to help in small ways. Small ways that made the seeming impossible task of repairing a ten ton machine with only one arm, possible. Rex did not have as much to fix on his mech IronWolf.
//   After a few hyper space jumps and a long slow ride to the planet. Rex and the team from Clan MRB make it to the planet Engadin.

//   Everyone was sitting around the only table eating when Tammy
//  Everyone was in the kitchen, sitting around the only table eating.
//  One morning before going back to work
  One morning after the mechs had been repaired, but they were still slowly traveling to the planet. Tammy suddenly stopped eating and looked at Rex, as if she had just remembered something she once thought was very important.
  "Where are you from?" Tammy asked. "I mean really."
  "Astroid orphan" Rex said between bites.
  "Which astroid? What were your parents names? When did they die?" Tammy prodded with barely a breath between each question.
  "I do not know, before I was born." Rex responded.
  Wilson laughed, a little food escaping his lips. "Your parents died before you were born?"

  Rex's face turned bright red. "No, I mean, they ... Uh I mean I ..."
  "No place you need to run back too?" Phil asked. Saving Rex from the awkward moment.
//   "Nowhere" Rex responded, keeping his eyes on this Mech IronWolf, who was expended to full Mech size. Keeping IronWolfs transformation a secret.
//   "No family for clan to go back to?" Wilson asked.
  "Nope, just me. But now I have IronWolf." he said.
  "Good" Phil said as walking in, "You can stick around and help us out for a bit."
  "I don't need your help" Rex protested.
  "Of course you don't. I'm not helping you, you owe me money for transport and repairs." Phil said.
  "Oh." Res said. "IronWolf is fixed, I did not use any of your supplies or anything."
  Wilson gave Rex a look, "An astroid boy that thinks power and air are free?"
  "Anyway" Phil gave Wilson the stink eye. Then he turned to face Rex directly. "I'm sure by the time you pay me off, you'll have found your own place and figured out your next steps." Phil said.
//   "Oh I know what I am going to do." Rex said. "IronWolf and I are going to enter the tournament. We are going to win a place in the grand tournament and prove to the galaxy that I am the best Mech Warrior."
  "I am going to be the best Mech Warrior the galaxy has ever seen." Rex said brimming with confidence. "I will find a tournament, work my way to the top and then get invited to fight in the Galactic Championship."
  IronWolf, in his large Mech size, picked that moment to exhaust steam. Almost as if it had been listening to the conversation and was scoffing at Rex's comment.
//   IronWolf let out a huff of exhaust at Rex's comment.
  "And after you are declared the best fighter in the galaxy?" Wilson asked.
  Rex didn't have an answer to that question.

  "Tammy and Rex," Phil finally said. "I want you to go out and get some replacement parts. See if you can find some weapons for IronWolf. I doubt he will win very many tournaments with just those claws."

  Tammy lead Rex out and into the city of New Rock. The roads between buildings where wide and reenforced. The buildings often had armor on the lower levels.
  Tammy laughed at Rex's dumb look. "You've never been to a Mech city before?" she asked.
  "No room, Mechs were always in garages or being transported to arenas." Rex said as he looked around as they walked.
  The sidewalks where large and filled with people. Small groups of people stood near trees or patches of grass. Even with all the people around, no one was interacting with anyone else.
  Rex pointed at a pair of people with their eyes glazed over as they viewed a virtual world. "That is what I am used too, everyone in their own world." People could tune out the entire world, and their personal cores using agumented sensors would make sure you never accidently bumped into another person.
//   "No, space was tight growing up, and there are few uses
//   "No, I grew up in a colony. We didn't have the room for Mechs." Rex responded as they walked down a busy road. Lots of people walking around, many chatting in groups, and many more with their eyes white glossed over as they focused on the virtual world. Their augmented eyes automatically incorporating the real world obstacles. Back at the colony people spent most of their time in these virtual worlds. Rex had hoped that people in the Mech cities would spend a little less time in the virtual world. But this city feels a lot like his cramped childhood.
//   "This city was built in the very old days. Some say it is hundreds of thousands of years old." Tammy continued. "I guess back then everyone had a Mech and just took them to got shopping or to work." Tammy gave an exaggerated shrug.
  "This city has survived since the ancient wars. The giant walls with room for Mechs to partol. Armored buildings that are tall and wide apart. The space that used to be roads for mechs had been converted into green walkways for the humans.
  They came to a tall building, it looked like all the other tall building as far as Rex could see. They passed massive 50 meter garage doors that went all the way to the top of building. They looked like they where build to let Mechs enter. or to open an entire side of the building.
  "Is this a garage?" Rex asked while pointing at the garage doors.
  "Something like that" Tammy said.
  When they walked in, Rex was not prepared for the showroom before him. The building was broken into floors, each floor tall enough for even an Atlas to walk around on the ground floor. A large clear elevator big enough to move a Mech ran up the center of the building. On either side were two smaller human sized elevators. This opening in the center of the building allowed Rex to look up and see parts of the higher floors. Sparkling new Mechs sitting in coves, weapons, armor, and and wide arrange of devices filled the store.

  A man came up to the pair. "How might I help you today?" he asked.
  Tammy pulled out an augmented file from her core and displayed it in front of her for the salesman. He started scanning the list, making little check marks next to some items and crosses on others.
  "We have most of this ready, things like an extended range focusing crystal are ... a bit more challenging."

  Rex wondered off and was walking down an aisle of lasers and cannons that could be mounted to a Mech. There was a wide array of small to large lasers, missiles, and cannons. Rex was trying to figure out the difference between two similar looking heavy lasers when IronWolf opened a channel to his core. "Perfect timing" Rex said to IronWolf. "I'm looking for some weapons for you. Since we wrecked the only one you had. Do you have any restrictions I should know about? I mean with your transformation and everything. Do I need some special adaptors or something?"
  # "I know, I've been watching."
  "I can adapt to work with any ancestor tech." IronWolf said. "Right now I am limited on power."

  Rex moved along the aisle and found the upgrades and armor for Mechs. There was a cloak, but it's price was beyond Rex's dreams. He would have to have the backing of someone powerful to afford a cloak.

  * [Active Sensors] Rex was looking at Active Sensors.
    "These can detect even cloaked Mechs, but they also tell everyone else where you are."
  * [Energy Shield] Rex was looking at an Energy Shield.
    "A short lasting energy shield that deflects laser and heat blasts." There is a small video that shows a mech activating the energy shield while another mech shoots six medium lasers at close range. The internal temperature of the shielded mech only rose a quarter of a degree.
  * [Electronic Counter Measures] Rex was looking at ECM or Electronic Counter Measures.
    "Keep the opponent from targeting you. Screws up missile guidance systems and decreases the accuracy of all computer based targeting."

   After placing their orders, they entered the city regional battle tournament with IronWolf and Wolfhound. It was an easy way to pick up money. The city hosts daily battles. The pay was not great, and their was a waiting list to get in, but it was decent work. And it didn't require any paperwork or credentials to get. You just needed to show up in a working mech.

  It was not long until Rex was called up for his first battle. A regional battle, two verses two. Rex and Tammy were selected to represent the group.

  IronWolf, decked out with a heavy laser and two long range missile racks. Wolfhound, decked out with an extended range heavy laser and four medium range lasers.
  The arena  started out as a dirt circle a kilometer in diameter. Camera drones flew around and followed each mech. A clear barrier separates the Mech battle from the audience.
  The announcer hovers out on a platform. "This is a standard two versus two match. Terrain will be randomly generated at the start of the match. Weapons free sixty seconds after start. Winner gets a cash prize."

  Across from them, Rex could see the other team. They faced a Red Shift, a bipedal mech like Tammy's Wolfhound. Red Shift only carries two medium lasers instead of hands. But the 20 ton mech had a top speed of 151 kph. They also had a 30 ton Osiris featuring only one small laser, but four racks of long range missiles.

  The announcer pulled a lever and a big display showing all the possible arena layout scrolled by.
  "Looks like we are evenly matched." Tammy said to Rex over their private channel. "Red Shift is a speed Mech like you, do you think you can keep him from getting close?"
  Rex smiled, "Sure, just keep those missiles off me."
  "I thought you were fast?" Tammy joked.

  The arena spinner stopped on a dense forest. "Perfect for the wolf team" the announcer said. "Dense forest combat. Lots of cover, but be careful of starting fires or getting trapped. The environment takes out as many would be warriors as do their opponents."

  In a flash, white light filled the stage, causing Rex and Tammy to shield their eyes. When the light faded down there was a thick green forest in front of them. Rex couldn't see any paths in front of them.

  "Remember, sixty seconds before you can free weapons. A miss fire is an automatically disqualification." The announcer said. A loud buzzer rang in the air. Tammy immediately started running to the left, around the outside of the circular arena, outside of the forest.

  Rex took a deep breath, and ran into the forest. Trees and vines snapping as the Mech ran forward. Rex's radar was filled with static and noise, he was running but he wasn't sure where he was running to. "Do you have a location?" He asked Tammy.

  "Shit, no my radar is scrambled. They must have some electronic countermeasures deployed." she replied. "I'll try to draw some fire and you can use that to find their position."

  * [Next]
  -
  "But won't they know your position" Rex started to say as a bright red flash of laser swept in front of him. "Shit, that's me" he yelled over the channel. The trees in grasses burning to black carbon before they could get a fire going.

  "That wasn't me" Tammy said.

  The next laser did not miss. A laser got a direct hit on the side of IronWolf. Rex could feel the Mechs pain as his right side started to heat and burn. IronWolf turned around facing Red Shift. Rex pulled out the trigger, a volly of long range missiles said over Red Shift and crashed randomly far behind it's target.
  "No!" Rex shouted. "Lasers!"

  Another blast from Red Shift's other arm, sliced down the side of IronWolf. A warning popped up in Rex's vision.

  * WARNING: overheating detected in missile storage.

  -
  Red Shift turned to run back in the forest. Rex's leg slipped as he tried to move IronWolf into a chase, the mech falling and slipping in the carbon remains of the trees and plant life.

  Tammy's displays automatically started feeding in the battle information into her view. Showing the most likely location of Red Shift based on the firing. Which told her that Osiris must be targeting her. His missiles would fly right over the forest, while her lasers must blast a clear path to him. She managed to get a quarter around the arena so far, hoping to get close enough that Osiris wouldn't be able to use it's Long Range Missiles and she could use her very effective medium range lasers.

  Flashes of light as a barrage of missiles flew out from the missile of the forest, near the suspected position of Red Shift and IronWolf. The missiles flew wildly, covering a much larger area than they normally would. She got a ping from IronWolf's AI to her Mechs AI, a blue highlight in the distance. Tammy's sensors wouldn't have been able to detect it on their own. A missile had landed close to the Osiris, opening a vary narrow clear shot. She would lose the shot if the Mech moved. Holding her breath, she stopped and fired everything. her AI targeting coordinating with IronWolfs AI. The four medium laser blasted first, burning away everything in the way, but not reaching the distant mech. The extended range heavy laser focused on the leg join of the Osiris, the leg glowing red from over heating. The Mech tried to take a step, and the weekend join bent and collapsed under the weight. The Osiris fell to one knee.

  Rex was in tight pursuit of Red Shift. The other Mech running between large trees, and firing off a laser shot behind it when able. Rex and IronWolf were running, easily dodging the half aimed shots taken at it. He should couldn't quite catch up. Every time Rex got close to Red Shift, the mech would change directions, causing IronWolf to lose momentum. With trees breaking all around him, Rex continued to follow Red Shift right out of the forest and heading towards Tammy in her Wolfhound. Rex tried to push the already fully extended throttle. His mind felt like it was becoming one with IronWolf's, he could feel his hands tingling.

  Blue flames erupt from IronWolfs from claws. The Mech leaped into the area, blue flames streaking behind it. The claws just reaching Red Shift's back. The claws tear into the mech severing both of it's arms.

  A buzzer rings over the arena as all the Mech start powering down.
  "What a battle!" The announcer says. "Clan MRB wins!"

  Rex and Tammy are taken to the winners circle, crowds cheering them and the announcer awarding them their metals. It was everything Rex dreamed it would be. All the screaming fans, everyone trying to ask him questions and wanting to spend time with him. Afterward they went out to enjoy some of the money they earned.

  That night at one of the clubs a sleazy looking man approached Rex and handing him a card. ( but like, future science fiction version of a card. Like a contact or something.)

  "Saw you at the fight tonight" the man said. His car said his name was Leroy. "You have quite an intresting Mech there."
  "Thanks" Rex said and took a long drink, eyes locked on he man.
  "Are you sighed up with a clan yet?" He asked, "or do you prefer mercenary, maybe one on one combat?"
  "Uh, no I guess not." Rex said.
  "You were teamed up with a member of Clan MRB tonight, are you joining them?" The man slide over closer to Rex. So close that Rex could smell the cheap cologne and stale beer. "Because, if you are up for a real challenge, I mean you would have to be able to hold your own here, I have a client that could make you some serious coin."
  "How much are we talking?" Rex asked.

  "You could lose, and walk away with four times what you made tonight. If you win, well, lets just say the V.I.P. treatment won't be good enough for you."
  "What do I have to do?" Rex asked.
  "Fight for my client and win. Easy peasy." Leroy said with a big smile.
  "What's the catch?" Rex asked suspiciously.
  "Who said there is a catch? This isn't some gene in the bottle deal." Leroy turned his whole body to face Rex and looked into his eyes. "It's simple. Winning fighters not only win money for themselves, but also for the team they represent. I was impressed with your Mech and that claw attack. As you know Clan Kirby almost won this years championship with a mech that punched though other mechs. You win, we all make money and maybe you can be our secret weapon in the next championship tournament."

= theme_and_notes
  The point I want to make with this story is about how we see ourselves in relation to our mind and body. (point is the wrong word I think.)
  Most people assume they are in complete control of their bodies. For the most part our body does what we want, so it makes sense that we are in control. Some people have noticed and written about over the years that we do not have complete control. They describe things like demons or angles that force them to act. A great modern day example of this is The Oatmeal's character the Blerch. A fat little daemon that is lazy and fights against what The Oatmeal wants to accomplish. (There are many other references go back as far as the greeks.)

  The Blerch is a good way of thinking about it, but I think it is still backwards.
  We don't have a Blerch that tries to get us to do bad/lazy things. We are the Anti-Blerch trying to tell the body what to do. We are the daemon, the part we think of when we think of ourselves. Some call it a soul, I call the the frontal cortex (named because right now thats the part of the brain I understand to be responsible for everything we call the self.)

  The old style Mech reflect the old understanding. A human/soul/frontal cortex is in complete control of the mech. It doesn't move without direct control.

  The new style Mechs reflect the new understanding. The body is not a dumb machine, but a sophisticated system of emotions and survival instincts.

  Most of the time, the body listens, most of the time you only ask simple things of it, like brush teeth, goto work. Things you do without thinking about how you are doing it. Sometimes the body reacts on it's own, blerting out a comment you wish it hadn't said, or altering the messages and signals to be more emotional than the sender actually put into it.

  "I would like to say, that everything ended happily ever after. But the world has never really worked that way. Everything on the battle field is so much simpler. After Clan Aurigan compound was defeated, the police and investigators arrived. And shortly after word the video appeared." Rex said.

  He was dressed in nice pressed government clothing. The kind you only wear to court. Not to be confused with clothing the government gives you, like after they arrest you for protesting. Rex was sitting in a nice chair with bright lights on him and a woman also in a sharp suit sitting next to him.

  "Ah yes, I think we have all seen the ... video" Sally said. In the screens, special effects had been added and overlaid placed on the image. To everyone watching it looked like a normal news interview.
  To Rex it was a small box, a waiting cell while he was being moved from area to area. This had not been what he was expecting at all.

  The video played on the screen. It showed clips from the battle between IronWolf and Atlas. It showed the head of Clan Aurigan admit that he cheated Rex and many other pilots and investors. It ended with a shot of the crushed Atlas and an investigator holding up what was supposed to be safety steel, but was just burnt chard metal.

  "Wow, just wow" Sally said. "You are a hero, you really are."
  Rex blushed. "I did not do it alone." he said.
  "No need to be modest. Clan Aurgian has done billions in economic damage with their cheating. Thousands of lives have been destroyed just like you." Sally wiped a tear from her eye. "Now as I understand it, the fight is not over for you yet."

  Rex had rehearsed this part all morning. "That is right Sally. Clan Aurgian was officially disbanded, but they are still sueing me for damages and harassing me and my clan."

  "How horrible!" Sally said. "This former clan Aurgian has broken one of the the golden rules. The golden rules that keep the universe in peace, the rules that ended the several millennium long mech wars. The universe has never be so prosperous since the golden rules were created." Sally's face turned from a sad smile, to an angry rage. "They broke the golden rules, destroyed lives, and now they are terrorizing people." //like poor one arm Rex here."

  * [After the interview]
  -

  Phil shook Rex's hand. They were standing in the garage they had been using as base and home. "Welcome as an official member to Clan Mercenary Review Board, or Clam MRB as we like to call it."
  "Mercenary Review Board? Are we bureaucrats or something?" Rex asked.
  Tammy scoffed, but otherwise did not say anything.
  "A very long time ago." Phil smiled. "During the ancient wars we acted like an agency for mercenaries looking for work. I think our strict structure is one of the reasons our clan has managed to last so long." Phil winked.
  "So what do we do now?" Rex asked.
  "Fight in tournaments, guard duty,  deep undercover investigations of claims of cheating. Pretty much what you have been doing." Wilson said.

  Wilson and Tammy had been putting away the last of the boxed into the ship. Rex noticed for the first time how efficient they had been in packing and moving. When he was staying in this garage it never felt like they were staying temporally or living out of boxes. And the ship, while tight on space was not cluttered and cramped with storage.

  "Did you already know about clan Aurgian's cheating?" Rex asked.
  Wilson and Phil looked at each other and smiled. "It is possible that we came to this planet because we heard some rumors."

  Tammy loaded the last box and walked over to Rex. "Alright, now it is your turn."
  "What? my turn for what?" Rex asked.
  "To come clean, about IronWolf. Plus you owe me a mech remember?" Tammy said.

  "I uh.." Rex stammered. IronWolf shrunk down to his normal size and walked over to Rex. "You might have figured this out already, but IronWolf is not a normal mech."
  Phil and Wilson's eyes widened in surprise. They went over the the shrunk mech, examine him.
  "Incredible" Wilson said. "Where does the rest of your mass go?"

  IronWolf responded. "In the fifth dimension."

  * [Next]
  -

  "Amazing, how are you controlling your projection into our four dimensions?" Wilson asked.

  The blue line that tattooed across IronWolf glowed faintly. "You see this line?" IronWolf asked. "It is a straight line, It is actually my main power conduit. It is over 7.5 million kilometers long."

  Everyone, even Rex gasped at his. The blue line always looked like a crazy random pattern to Rex. Ot crosses over on it self and loops in many places. Rex had been thinking about it like it was war paint for something. His mind could not even comprehend that the line could be straight.

  After a few moments Tammy coughed to get everyone's attention. "Let us not forget one very important point." she said.
  "What is that?" Phil asked.
  "Rex promised to get me a next generation mech like IronWolf." she said.
  "I did not promise that!" Rex protested. "I said I would lead you to were you could find one."
  "How did you get IronWolf?" Phil asked.
  "Well, he actually found me. I didn't even know he was a mech at first."
  "I can see why" Wilson said while petting IronWolf. "So were do we go? back to XX Planet were we found you?"

  "No" IronWolf said. He uploaded a location to the holographic projector in the room. A star chart appeared. "We go there."
  Phil manipulated the controls and zoomed in on the planet, opening it's status window. It was inhabitable, but suffered from strong winds that made takeoff and landing difficult. There was a small human settlement that exported mostly virtual goods since the planet was dangerous for physical transport.

  "I have never heard of a mech factory on this planet." Phil said. "It doesn't seem like a good location according to the accent war maps."
  "Those winds made it easy to defend though." Wilson said, still petting IronWolf.
  "Mechs are too valuable to leave around." Phil said. "If they had a factory they would find a way to export them, even with the strong winds."

  "Maybe they have" Wilson suggested.


  * [Arrive on planet]

  The arrived above the planet. Sensors shows extreme winds in the upper atmosphere. Willson and Phil were looking over display of the plant conditions.
  "It wold be safer to just drop them" Wilson said.
  "How would we get them back up?" Phil asked.
  "We could always figure that out later." Wilson said.
  "No, if we have to take the drop ship down to get them anyway, then we might as well all go together."
  "The weather could clear?" Wilson suggested half heartedly. "Or if they survive the drop we could drop some fuel. or maybe they could buy some fuel down there."
  "Too risky." Phil said.

  * [Next]
  -

  Rex and Tammy entered the room. "What is a drop?" Rex asked.
  "basically, " Tammy said, "you and your mech stand on top of a rocket, and try not to hit the ground so hard you die."
  "Sounds fun" said Rex.
  "See" Wilson interjected, "they are all for it."
  "It is just too risky. We can barely scan past that interference. We would not be able to help them if anything went wrong. It would be better if we stay together."
  "We are not children" Tammy said. "Are we able to talk to the settlement down there?"
  "Yeah" Wilson answered.
  "Then we will be fine. If something goes wrong, then you can bring in the ship. Otherwise gather some fuel and be ready to drop it when we need to return." Tammy turned and walked out of the room.
  Everyone else just looked at Phil.
  "Alright, Rex, you and Tammy will drop together in an egg with IronWolf. When you find her mech, we will drop the other egg with enough fuel to bring you both back. Is that understood?" Phil said.
  "Yes sir." Rex said suppressing a smile. He turned and quickly left the room.

  * [Next]
  -

  Once they were alone, Phil turned the star back to another set of planets. He pointed at a small moon. "There."
  Wilson looked worried. "Are you sure they will be fine without us?"
  "Were you not the one just fighting for them to go out on their own?" Phil asked.
  "Well, on their own when we are in orbit is one thing. But it will take us six weeks round trip alone. We should at least tell them."
  "No." said Phil. "It will be fine. I got Tammy so worked up that she'll call once, and then forget until she has her mech."
  "What if they find the mech quickly?" Wilson asked.
  Phil smiled. "Guess we will have to figure that out later."

  * [Drop to the planet]
  -
  Rex and Tammy were fitted with hazard suits. They could protect them in the vacuum of space, or a hard fall from a short distance. Lighter that battle armor, they provided a wider range of critical systems.
  The egg looked exactly like that. A large black egg, the tip held a small cockpit that sat two people. And in the widest part of the ship held one mech, IronWolf. Although with IronWolf being in his shrunk down size, there was enough room to load up on extra food, fuel, and camping and survival supplies. Even the ship could be used as a shelter in an emergency.

  With everything loaded, the countdown started. At Zero the large hatch doors under the egg opened up, revealing the planet below. In what felt like slow motion, the egg started to fall from the mother ship. Soon the bottom was red hot as it crashed though the planets thicker atmosphere. The screens inside showed a radar and scanner enhanced view. Strong currents pushed the Egg significantly off course as it made its way into the lower atmosphere. Without the extra weight of a heavy mech, the egg started to tip in the high winds.

  "IronWolf, quick, we need you to be as heavy as possible" Tammy yelled over the roar of the wind.
  IronWolf's blue line glowed brighter as the mech started to grow larger. first to 10 tons, then to 15 tons, 20 tons, 25 tons, 40 tons, 45 tons. 50 tons.
  "Ok stop!" Tammy yelled.
  IronWolf stopped growing at 55 tons.
  Rex looked back, "I did not know you could do that!" he yelled.
  "I could not do it before. Our experience has lead to a number of improvements of my systems."
  "You two can flirt later" Tammy Yelled, "Brace for impact.

  * [Next]
  -

  The rockets fired, causing everything inside to jerk as the ship suddenly slowed. It continued to slow more and more until it landed softly on the ground.

  The egg opened up, Tammy and Rex walked out into a green meadow. It was filled with short shin high grass as far as they could see. A cool wind swept over the meadow, forming patterns of light and darkness as the wind moved the grass.

  IronWolf walked out in his normal wolf size. He sniffed the air. "Good, we are close" he said as he walked off.
  "Close to what?" Rex asked as he followed after.

  * [Next]
  -

  Tammy looked around. The sky was filled with birds of all sizes. She did not see any of those on the scanners. Tammy could smell salt in the air. She followed the smell, away from Rex and IronWolf. Soon she found herself standing on the ledge of a tall cliff. She could not see to the bottom, fog or mist or maybe even a cloud blocked the view. She could see for miles on the horizon. huge never ending cliff walls. Bright white with spots of vegitation.
  A large flying bird flew up from the cliff in front of her. A single wing spanning larger than the entire egg ship. "Whoa" is all Tammy could say.

  Rex could feel the tingling sensation as this mind connected with IronWolf transforming him into the mech. They expanded to IronWolf's full size and howled. They reached out to the compounds security system and ordered all the doors open.
  Loud bangs popped all over the compound as garage doors rolled up at full speed. They could see down into the tunnel, the one they used to get the mech into the lab in the first place.
  Rex looked down at Tammy, she was smiling. "Good Luck" she said before running off back into the human size hallway.

  Yellow flashing lights on top of security bots filled the corridor in front of IronWolf and Rex. They where already ordering him to halt. IronWolf smiled. This would be fun.
  Blue lines of energy lit up along IronWolfs body as he activated his rush. In the blink of an eye IronWolf had reached the end of the hallway, leaving the security bots as scraps of metal. He moved at near the speed of sound, running past each security bot, kicking it into the wall, and running to the next one.
  IronWolf ran down the tunnels. The only exit was at the arena. And he knew the other clan would be ready for him. The mechs that were already at the Arena would be there for sure, if not the security mechs that patrolled the compound.
  IronWolf turned down the last bend, and he could see light at the end of the tunnel. The arena was before them. It was a view Rex knew all too well from his time fighting here. This time, the stakes were real. This was not just a game anymore, this was about freedom and survival.

  * [Enter the Arena]
  -

  IronWolf sent out a small decoy done to do a sensor ping in the arena. It turned out that the other clan was less aware of what was happening that Rex had assumed. There were two lighter mechs standing in the middle of the arena. They had not been looking in his direction until they saw the sensor ping.

  * [Fight: 2x Red Shifts]
  -

  IronWolf makes quick work of these light mechs. They never land a hit as IronWolf short range teleported behind them. Claws in flaming blue fire cut down both mechs. Their pilots safely ejecting.

  * [Missiles Warning!]
  -
  A shower of forty missiles rained down around IronWolf. Rex and the AI working together trying to avoid the missiles. Teleport, jump, dash, zig. But there were too many missiles. Several managed to score hits on IronWolf. The mech staggered under the barrage.

  A voice echoed in the voice channel. "You think you can just walk out of here?" The voice demanded. "With *MY* mech!"
  As the smoked cleared, Rex could see four Catapults surrounding them. Their missile racks already reloading.

  IronWolf stood up. He turned on his external speakers fo he could be heard by everyone in the area, "We do not belong to you. You are slaver scum and we will make you pay."

  The Catapults launched another wave of forty missiles at IronWolf.

  * [Next]
  -

  Rage filled Rex and IronWolf. The emotion flooding their minds and bodies. The blue line along IronWolfs body morphed into a menacing red.  IronWolfs eyes became pinpoints of red focused dots.
  IronWolf rushed forward, leaving an after image of red light as he quickly reached the first Catapult, Jumping up and landing on it's head. The weight caused the two mechs to topple over, crushing in the catapult. It's pilot barely managing to eject. IronWolf's paw caught the pilot in mid-air. He threw the pilot back at his own missiles about to rain down on IronWolf. Dozens of missiles flying to closely in the air explodes causing a cascading ripple of explosion
  IronWolf was already approaching the next Catapult.
  The Catapult opened fire with all his his lasers at IronWolf. A direct hit.
  The laser energy was pulled into the red lines tattooing IronWolfs body. The lines flashed with fire as IronWolf opened his mouth to reveal a particle projector, now overcharged from the Catapults own lasers. The beam of energy vaporized the left side fo the Catapult. The Mech fell over with a dead thud.
  Missiles rained around IronWolf. He managed to dodge, but barely. IronWolf was overheating quickly and running out of power. He had to finish these last two off quickly. With the AI figuring out the best approach. they took off in a run. saving their power. The Catapults had time prepare for IronWolf's approach. It fired a laser, making IronWolf dodge, then fired another a laser, causing IronWolf to dodge again. As IronWolf approached to jump, he stopped instead. The Catapult fired his last laser in the air, where he thought IronWolf would be, instead the mech crouched down and between the legs fo the Catapult.
  IronWolf fired the partical projector at the Catapult in the distance, strikign a direct hit and breaking it's leg. IronWolf was out of power. The Catapult standing over it only realized then, that the missiles were still tracking IronWolf.
  The Last of the missiles struck the Catapult, and finishing it off. IronWolf rested a moment until he had enough power to move again. The red line having faded off.

  * [A voice boomed over the arena]
  -
  "Aw, is the little wolf too tired to play?" The menacing voice echoed. "I would have been here sooner, but I had to take care of a rat."
  The arena's holograph displays showed a video of Tammy struggling against armed security guards. They had her locked in a holding cell the arena uses for drunks and other disorder-lies.

  IronWolf stood up. A blue lines started faint, and grew brighter, the line that tattooed around IronWolfs body. "Bring it" IronWolf called out right after he rushed in a zag across the field.
  The ground IronWolf had been standing on exploded as a giant slug slammed into it. The Atlas walked out from the arena exit.

  "This time kid" the Atlas said. "This time you will lose a lot more than an arm."

  * [Boss Battle]

  Final boss gameplay goes here.

  * [Rex Wins]

  The Atlas lay in ruins, Rex and IronWolf making the final blow. The head of the compound trapped in the crushed cockpit.
  "Please" the man said. "You have to help me."
  Rex and IronWolf scoffed at him. "Your cockpit collapsed because you used a thiner weaker metal instead of the regulation carbon steel. Looks like it was really good at dissipating heat as well. Shame you cut back on silly things like life support and structural integrity."
  The man spit blood at Rex and IronWolf. "No one ever got a hit on me. It did not need to be strong."
  "I happen to agree" Rex and IronWolf said as they turned and walked away.

= how_battle_works
  + So how do you win a battle?
    // The opponent can no longer continue the fight.
    Each mech fights until they overheat. Taking actions and getting hit by weapons will build of HEAT in the mech. If they overheat, the reactor will automatically shut down to avoid exploding. When that happens the battle is over.
    -> how_battle_works
  + How do you disable the opponent?
    Laser and other energy weapons deal direct HEAT to the opponent. Physical weapons like missiles and claws destory HEAT SINKS. These Heat sinks are how the mech dissipates heat each turn of battle.
    // Physical damage, which is protected by armor.
    // Overheating, which is protected by heat sinks.
    // Weapons destroyed/out of ammo.
    -> how_battle_works
  + How does Heat work?
    Heat builds up in both mechs when lasers are fired. Most of the heat concentrated on a single point on the defender.
    Weapons will not fire if they are too hot.
    Engines shut down if they get too hot.
    Missiles explode if they get too hot.
    Armor and superstructure can warp and melt if they get too hot.
    The main goal of lasers is to disable parts of the opponent or melt though their armor. Setting off missiles inside an opponent mech can be quite the show.
    Moving and firing weapons generate heat.
    Heat Sinks will continually dissipate heat.
    -> how_battle_works
  + How does power generation work?
    Weapons and movement have a power requirement to work. When the Mech wants to take an action, like moving or firing, or jumping, it uses up some of the stored power in the mech. It's internal rector is continually recharging these internal batteries.
    It is possible for Mechs to not have battery systems (a lot of the old generation mech are this way) which limits their action to the max contous output of their reactors.
    The reactor has a set temperature cutoff value and the amount of heat it generates to produce that continues output.
    This means it is possible for a Mech to do something like fire it's lasers continually. The reactor will have no issue, but the laser will eventually heat up to the point it shuts down or breaks.
    -> how_battle_works
  + Physical Damage and armor
    Mechs weigh a lot because of all their Equipment and armor. Armor protects the mechs from physical damage, like IronWolf's physical claws, or the swords and hatchets some mechs carry.
    The more armor, the slower the acceleration/max speed and the more power required to move the mech.
    This armor protects from missiles, and redirects heat to heatsinks.
    -> how_battle_works
  + Overview
    Heat Management, limits how often you can attack/move.
    Weapons/Armor Management, limits speed, acceleration, and scanner footprint.
    Equipment, provides special overrides to limits or new abilities.
    Weight, Limits the number and how much weapons, armor, and equipment a mech can carry.
    -> how_battle_works
  + Game Dev notes
    Each trackable area of a mech, the body, arms, legs, etc all have a heat meter. Each turn that meter will reduce by the number of active heat sinks connected to it (and functional.)
    The player can take an action, which causes one or more parts to generate some amount of heat.
    The player can get hit with energy weapons, which generate some amount of heat across one or more areas.
    Each area has a different reaction to the overheating depending on what is inside the mech. Example: and area holding missiles could explode if it generates too much heat. Weapons will refuse to fire after they have too much heat and will be destroyed or disabled if then get even hotter.
    Water will cool heated area, like walking in a river or rain falling.
    -> how_battle_works
  + Parts of a Mech.
    Body, Cockpit, four limbs, (left arm, left leg, right arm, right leg or in cases like IronWolf just call all the limbs arms or legs or whatever makes you feel better about the terminology.)
    Each part has: Head, Armor, Internal structure; (Equipment and ammo must be stored in one of the internal structure areas), and hard points; (Places where it's structurally safe to mount weapons and other external equipment like countermeasure devices, cloaking devices, extra heat sinks.)
    The Mechs type and construction will determine the heat displacement, size of the internal storage and number of hard points. These factors are static on the mech type level. The NextGen mechs have the ability to change these factors.

So this is a small test to try the battle range.

If I move forward, that is from longer to shorter. I need to add 5 to the range.

If I add 2 + 3, then battle range becomes: {range} ({range_turn_delta}) It should be MEDIUM.

~ move_range(5)
If I add 5, then battle range becomes: {range} ({range_turn_delta}) It should be MEDIUM.

~ move_reset_delta()
~ range = LONG
~ move_range(10)
Move +10 {range} should equal LONG when range is long.
// If I add 10, then battle range becomes: {range} ({range_turn_delta}) It should be LONG.

~ move_reset_delta()
~ range = SHORT
~ move_range(-2)
~ move_range(-3)
Move -2, then Move -3 in the same turn, {range} should equal MEDIUM when starting at short range.
// If I remove 2 - 3, then battle range becomes: {range} ({range_turn_delta})

~ move_reset_delta()
~ range = SHORT
~ move_range(-5)
Move -5, {range} should equal MEDIUM when starting at a short range.
// If I remove 5, then battle range becomes: {range} ({range_turn_delta})

-> END## MCU conclusion to infinity wars.

Captain Marvel kills Thanos, the snap is not reversed. Everyone that died stays dead or they are "alive" in another dimension that our "living" Heros can only visit.

Tony gets a crazy idea to reverse the Snap, and is sure of his theory because Dr Strange saved him. Tony assumes this means he can fix everything, or else Dr Strange would have held on to the stone.

Tony does everything he can to invent a way out, including rescuring Ant-Man from the quantion realm. Together they will figure out something they think will work.

Captain Marvel arrives, finds out what happened, and goes out to fight Thanos. Eventually it comes down to beating Thanos and using Tony's new tech to save everyone.

Tony's device does not work as expected, and the snap become permeant. Thanos is killed or forced to live with the people he snapped.

The existence of the super powered aliens are revealed and the mutations they caused in humans (inhumans/xman) will be official revealed to the entire world. A new group of Heros will band together and go out into the comos.

= start
  After a lot of long and hard fought battles, Rex had made it. He was going up against the champion.
  Rex sat on a small bed next to IronWolf, the two of them plugged in together though Rex's port on his missing arm.
  
  * [Next] 
  -
  
  "I thought you wanted to be the galaxy champion" IronWolf asked.
  "Well yeah, of course." Rex said.
  "So why are you so excited about the fight this weekend?" IronWolf asked. "This is just some underground fighting arena. We haven't even left this planet since we arrived." IronWolf snorted "Seems like an awfully small galaxy to me."
  "What? Where is this coming from?" Rex asked. "We have been winning! Look at all the money we've earned, all the upgrades we have. We win the champaionship here, and we can get into the galaxy qualifying rounds."
  "So more time here? In this place?" IronWolf asked.
  "Temporary!" Rex said. "We just need to keep pressing forward. We are so close."
  IronWolf just looked at him.
  "I promise you" Rex said. "After this match, we will leave."
  "Really?" IronWolf said.
  "Yeah. After this match we will take our winnings and charter a ship somewhere else." Rex said. "It is a galaxy wide tournament after all."
  "I hope we get to see a lot of different planets" IronWolf said. "Even if we lose."
  Rex smiled. "We won't lose. We are awesome."

  * [Final Battle]
  -
  
  This was it, Rex and IronWolf made their way though the underground tunnels between the Aurigan compound and the arena. In the tunnels, people, fans, mechanics, lines the hallway and watched as he passed. When he arrived, he was in the starting position of the arena. A bright sun overheat, and a desert setting. A few cactuses and no water.
  Rex smiled. "Perfect, we should be able to overheat him in no time. a hot desert will hamper heatsink efficiency and no water means no easy way to cool down."

  The Atlas walked out from his side of the arena. The stadium camera footage was streaming into both pilots cockpit as they got ready. The Atlas looked different than the last battle. It's large heatsinks were fanned out, giving the mech a spiky shadows appearence. The heat radating off the mech made the immage shimmer from a distance.

  "The challenger Rex has earned the right to fight our champion!" The Announcer said over the channel. "Will he win? will he even last past the first shot? Our Atlas is a devastating foe to challenge."

  // IronWolf was ready. The moment the buzzer rang, he took off in a zig zag across the battle field. Running at incredible speed. IronWolf used {power_cost(Run, 1)} POWER and generated {heat_cost(Run, 1)} waste HEAT.
  // ~ perform(IronWolf, Run, 1)


  Milliseconds after IronWolf moved a large slug slammed into IronWolf's starting position. The loud sonic boom quickly following. The slug was the size of IronWolf's heat.
  // Atlas had fired it's Guass Rifle, using {power_cost(GuassRifle, 1)} POWER and generating {heat_cost(GuassRifle, 1)} waste HEAT.
  // ~ perform(Atlas, GuassRifle, 1)

  IronWolf tried to calculate the best evasive maneuvers while Rex guided the general direction. They where moving forward, which was easy considering the areana lacked any obsticals Rex and IronWolf could use.
  A breif wave of heat soared past IronWolf right when he zagged. The plasma ball from the Atla's partical projector seared by, missing by meters.
  // Atlas fired it's Partical Projector Cannon, using {power_cost(PPC, 1)} and generating {heat_cost(PPC, 1)} waste heat. IronWolf used {power_cost(Dodge, 1)} POWER to dodge the attack; generating {heat_cost(Dodge, 1)} waste HEAT.
  // ~ perform(Atlas, PPC, 1)
  // ~ perform(IronWolf, Dodge, 1)

  IronWolf managed to close the distance down to medium. Rex let IronWolf keep running while he aimed the Guass Rifle. A boom struck out as the slug impacted the unmoving Atlas.
  // IronWolf fired his Guass Rifle, using {power_cost(GuassRifle, 1)} POWER and generating {heat_cost(GuassRifle, 1)} waste HEAT.
  // ~ perform(IronWolf, GuassRifle, 1)

  The Atlas returned fire with 5 lasers. IronWolf was not able to dodge as the beams fired in the flash of light. IronWolf suddenly suffered from 10 HEAT damage, causing warning to flash on Rex's screen. He could feel the heat. One of the beams hat struct the cockpit.
  // Atlas fired 5 lasers, using {power_cost(Laser, 5)} POWER and generating {heat_cost(Laser, 5)} waste HEAT.

  "I can't take another hit like that" IronWolf said over the channel.
  "Good thing we updated your heatsinks" Rex responded "or we would be out of the battle all ready."

  * [Next]

  IronWolf dodged again, activating short range teleport to move faster than the Atlas's targeting computer could calculate. IronWolf dropped out of teleport right in front of the Atlas. He jumped, claws covered in a bright blue flames.
  The Atlas managed to rase an arm in defense. IronWolfs claws sliced though the limb, severing the Guass Rifle arm from the Atlas.
  In retaliation the Atlas's Autocannons opened fired, each round slamming into the armor of close range opponent. heatsinks chipping or cracking under the impacts before IronWolf could move out of range again.

  This time would have to be it. The Atlas fired laser after laser at IronWolf, but the mech was able to dodge teleport out of the way. IronWolf was a few dozen meters away. Rex setup and activated the claw attack while IronWolf calculated the jump and flight path. They were aiming for the heat this time. They needed to finish this in one hit.
  IronWolf landed from a teleport ready to leap. Heat warning flashed in Rex's vision. The mech was suddenly overloading. Rex could only watch as IronWolf shut down and the Atlas's Autocannons rained slugs down on the mech.
  Then it was over.
  "Winner!" The announcer said. "Atlas has overheated IronWolf!" The crowd cheered and booed, depending on who they bet on.
  Rex sat in the cockpit dumbfounded. How did he miss that? Did the Atlas hit him with something? He was in shock and frozen inside IronWolf's body.

  Tammy came with moving truck to pick up the broken and managed IronWolf. Outside the cockpit Rex sat down and held his head in his hands.
  Tammy put a hand on his shoulder. "It's ok, it's not the end of the world."
  Rex jumped up, throwing Tammy's hand off of him. "You don't know anything." he said as he stormed off.
  "You stupid jerk" Tammy said after he left. "I was trying to help you." she muttered to herself. She opened the video of the fight and ran it though her analyzer. Sure enough it picked up the same energy spike she had seen in the other quote unquote wins from this champion Atlas.
  She know for sure, Clan Aurigan was cheating, and they got Rex.

  [Writer's note: the fun and games section was one of the big player playing sections. I spent two days working on it and, I was able to make some progress.]
  [Writer's note: This section is after a lot of fighting and building up Rex's riches and upgrades. I am going to do the thing that everyone hates in games because it makes sense for the story (eh, maybe makes sense for the story?) Either way, I hope to turn this into a little detective section in a future draft.]
  [Writer's note: After looking up the midpoint again, I realized I was thinking of the bad guys close in, not midpoint, which is much smaller.]
  [Writer's note: This is the "Final Boss", or the player is supposed to think it is, (or assume it is not because of te trope). The player will win the battle, but the bad guys are going to win.]

= start
  Rex wiggled in the dirt next to the campfire, trying in vain to find a comfortable position. He had been camping before, but the uneven surfaces pressing at odd angles kept poking at him.
  His cyberntic eyes overlayed an interface over reality. Rex closed his eyes and layed back. He had full access to the glactic internet, even out here. The last battle in the Mech Warrior Camptionship was about to start. Rex's favorate, Clan Lyran was this years favorate to win. The other team, Clan Kirby was a new and upcomming clan. They took the galxy by surprise when they made it to the final battle.
  Each team had three Mechs, giant multi-ton fighting machines. Leftover from the old wars. The arena was large and featured a river running though the center and a dense forest on one side, with large rocks and dirt on the other side.
  The landscape of the Arena was fake of course, designed to give each side an even balance of risk and reward.

  The newcommer, clan Kirby's star mech was called CopperBanshee. It was a highly customized version of the Banshee and featured an amazing weapon, the Banshee Shreek. The mech's giant fist innightes into blue flames and punches at super sonic speeds. The sound of the 10 ton metal fist colliding with a 90 ton metal machine at supersonic speeds is an eeriely similar to a screech from the mythical creature.
//   Clan Kirby featured some strange Mechs, namely a 95 ton Mech named Banshee that featured a deadly punch and what appeared to be a cloak of flames. He won the last battle by punching a hole in the back of another Mech.
  The Banshee rushed as soon as the fight began, running at full speed towards Clan Lyran's Thunderbolt. As he did so, Clan Lyran's Mech Awesome moved into the desert side of the arena and opened fire with it's particle projector cannon on the Banshee. The beam of energy just missed as the Banshee charged forward, gaining speed.
  Before Mech Awesome could fire another shot, it was barraged with an array of long range missiles from Clan Kirby's Dervish. This caused the Mech to step back and lose focus on the Banshee.
  Clan Lyran's Thunderbold jumps into the air, it's twin gattling guns raining bullets on the rushing Banshee. And then it was gone.
  Even the annoucer sounded shocked. When the smoke cleared there was nothing for a moment, then a brilliant flash of ligth were the Banshee once stood.
  
  * PROXIMITY ALERT!
    A large red message flashed in Rex's vision, his core, a personal computer embeded in the right arm of each person, sent the message to his argumented eyeballs.
  
//   - Rex was jarred back to reality from the alert. He made some gestures and his vision changed to show a sensor sweep of his campsite. He gasped when it showed a large red dot directly in front of him. His eyes snapped open and he held back a scream. Only a foot away from him, was a large black wolf. The Wolf's head easly larger than his own.
  -
  He was alone, completely alone. His mind raced to think of what could be near. Wild beasts, runaway mechs. He dismissed the alert and his vision cleared. A large midight black Wolf sat in front of him. The creature sitting like a dog or wolf, and it was as large as Rex.
//   , so they where sitting eye to eye, looking at each other.
  
  * Run Away!
    Rex quickly scooted back along the ground, away from the creature. It didn't move, just watched him with unblinking eyes.
  * Stay Calm!
    Rex looked at the creature in the eyes. That is when he started to notice more details, the eyes, they lacked the depth of a living creature. The wolf was all black, what Rex thought was black fur, was actually black metal. Rex backed up a little, but he did not run away.
  
    - 
    He reached a hand out to the Wolf. The creature turned it's head, like it was scanning him, then in exheldt hot exaust from it's nose.
    They staired into eachothers eyes for a moment, then the wolf ran back into the woods.
    "How did it get so close without setting off the alarm?" Rex wondered while he stood up and walked around the camp. He was still shaking from the encounter, his heart registering 200 beats per minute.
    "I don't know what you are", Rex called into the woods where the wolf had left, "but I'll be your friend."
    He waited a while, but the Wolf did not return that night.

  ->-># Ideas
For all of this, we will assume a standard mech, perfectly average with all values at the base level. Once we have this, we can make special adjustments and scaling as needed.

## Ideas about Environment and Water
Standing in water, dissipates heat every turn. How much it dissipates depends on how much of the mech is underwater.

Environmental effects like rain, a desert, etc can affect how equipment works during battle. For example in a hot desert heatsinks don't work as well, dissipating less heat than normal.

## Ideas about distance and power.
Distance between the two fighting mechs determine their fighting range. Long Range, Medium Range, and Short Range. Every 5 POWER changes the range by 1 in either direction. This is a total movement spent by each mech.
>>> Attacker uses 3 power to move forward, range is still long.
>>> Defender uses 2 power to move forward, range is now medium because a total of 5 power was used moving forward (aka moving towards each other)

## Energy, Heat, Physical Damage (Draft 2)
The match is won by overheating your opponent before they overheat you.
Reactor generates POWER every turn, heatsinks remove HEAT every turn.
The number of Weapons/Equipment determines how many heatsinks are provided. ~Typically there is a 2-1 ratio as the baseline.~ Or it could be the waste HEAT + 1 is the baseline formula for heatsinks. Weapons can always cover their own waste and a little more. Makes sense that they would be build that way. I also like the idea that the base mech determines the number of heatsinks, and that limits the weapons, instead of the other way around. Plus equipment and abilities will adjust the final numbers.
Every action has a POWER cost to perform, including things like dodge or cloak or jump jets.
There are two types of weapons: Energy and Projectile.

#### Dodge
Every attack has both a a chance to detect, and a chance to dodge. This includes all weapon types, physical and energy. Missiles tend to be easier to detect and thus easier to dodge. Energy weapons are much harder to detect, but easier to dodge if you do detect them.

### Energy
These weapons turn energy spent into heat damage on an opponent. These weapons are not 100% efficient so some of the energy is turned into waste HEAT on the mech that fired the laser. As an example, our baseline laser takes 4 POWER to charge is 3 HEAT Damage, 1 HEAT waste. This base line sets up the base laser formula. Then it can be scaled and modified to create other energy weapons. It would keep the formula and scaling the same.
Energy weapons lose energy over distance.

* Base
  * 4 POWER to fire.
  * 3 HEAT Damage dealt to the mech hit.
  * 1 HEAT wasted on the mech that fired.
  * Damage / 2 per range after close. (Medium divides the final damage by two, Long divides it by 4)
  * Chance to dodge: 0
  * Type: Instant
  * Number of heat sinks provided/required: 2

### Projectile
These weapons use a small amount of POWER because everything costs POWER. But instead of dealing HEAT damage, they deal physical damage in the form of destroying heatsinks. You can not win with physical projectiles alone, to win you need to overheat the opponent, not deal physical damage. Projectile weapons carry a limited number of rounds ~and must be reloaded~.
Example baseline projectile might be missiles. 1 POWER to launch. Takes 1 Turn to reach target, Destroys 1 heatsink, 3 Rounds.

Thinking about it more, get rid of the delayed attack mechanic completely, keep the recharge (so projectiles do cost less POWER, but they spread it over two turns.)

* Base
  * 1 POWER and 1 Ammo to fire.
  * 1 destroyed heat sink as damage
  * 0 HEAT waste
  * Chance to dodge is 10%
  * ~Type: Delayed Hit +1 Turn~
  * Number of heat sinks provided/required: 1

### Mechs
Mechs come in all shapes and forms. A little bit like pokemon. The baseline mech is a 65 ton Catapult. It features both Missiles and Lasers, all at baseline levels.

* Base
  * Fusion Power Reactor that generates 5 POWER per turn.
  * Provides 10 heatsinks that remove 10 HEAT per turn.
  * Overheats at 20 HEAT.
  * Batteries can store 10 POWER total. Each turn the reactor puts power into the batteries, and during a turn the mech pulls power out of the batteries.
  * 5 POWER to change range in 1 turn. (Full Run)


### Abilities, Equipment, and Other
There are a limited number of variables that are used in the different calculations. Each of these parts of the formula can be altered by abilities, skills, equipment, whatever you want to call it. Since it's a battle tech style game, equipment works well.

An Example: Jump Jets. 4 POWER + 2 HEAT to add 1 height unit. 2 POWER + 1 HEAT to maintain existing height. Effect of being 1 unit height above opponent. All opponent dodge change is -45%, and your dodge chance is +10%. Range is increased by 1 for each height unit. So a mech using Jump Jets, can never be in close range to a mech on the ground. Even directly under the other mech, they would still be at medium range.

* Variables
  * POWER generation rate per turn.
  * HEAT dissipation rate per turn.
  * Max POWER limit (aka battery)
  * Max HEAT limit (aka overheating)
  * Range or distance between the mechs.
  * Cost to fire a weapon, POWER and/or Ammo.
  * Type and amount of damage dealt from weapons. Does it add HEAT or lower dissipation rate? By how much?
  * Chance to dodge an attack.
  * Number of heatsinks when the mech is 100% (In a way, the heatsinks are the mechs health.)
  * Projectiles in air.
  * Power requires for a full run (aka change the range in one turn.)
  * Position in 3D(-ish) space.
  * Energy cost type: One time like weapons, or every turn like jump jets, cloaks, power melee weapons

* Mech
  * Current POWER, HEAT, HEATSINKS
  * POWER Regeneration rate.
  * Max POWER
  * HEAT dissipation rate.
  * Max HEAT
  * Speed, Power over Range.
  * Position/distance on the battle field.
  * Dodge chance based on power/speed.
* Weapon
  * Cost to fire, POWER, HEAT, AMMO.
  * Damage dealt at range to HEAT or HEATSINKS
  * Number of heatsinks requires to equip the weapon.
  * Dodge chance
* Environment
  * End turn affects to POWER, HEAT, or AMMO.
  * Missiles in the air? (or should this be on the weapon?)
  * Things that affect Dodge chance (like smoke or obstacles.)


## Ideas about Health, Damage, Heat, etc (Draft 1)
A Mech can keep fighting until it reaches 20 HEAT. At that point it loses and the fight is over. The Mech automatically shuts down to avoid exploding.

There is no health or damage. Combat is about balancing POWER and HEAT.
Physical attacks like Missiles, Guass Rifles, Autocannon, and melee weapons destroy HEATSINKs. If a mech has no more HEATSINKs, then it will not only not dissipate any more heat, but the fusion reactor will produce 1 HEAT per turn. (This reactor heat is negated by having at least one heatsink.)
Energy attacks like Particle Projectors and Lasers turn POWER into HEAT on the opponent.

Unlike physical weapons that are ineffective or dodge-able and specific ranges, energy weapons always hit with a target lock. Energy weapons do loser power over distance.

Laser weapons work on a scale, Heaver lasers are able to use larger amounts of power to generate more heat in the target, while light lasers take less power, but provide little heat.

### Hardpoints
How many weapons can a mech hold? How many heatsinks?
Every Weapon or Equipment that can be mounted on a mech is also half a heatsink! The downside is that when two heatsinks are destroyed, so is the thing the heatsinks are attached to are also destoyed.
Hardpoints are fixed by the frame, weight, and size of the mech.

### Weapons
* Long Range Weapons:
  * Physical: Missiles, Gauss Rifle
  * Energy: Particle Projector
* Medium Range Weapons:
  * Physical: Gauss Rifle, Autocannon
  * Energy: Laser
* Short Range Weapons:
  * Physical: Melee, Autocannon
  * Energy: Laser

### Long Range
* Missiles
  * Physical, destroys a heatsink if hit.
  * Can only be fired when at LONG range.
  * Takes 1 turn to reach target.
  * If target is in MEDIUM range, there is a chance for the other mech to spend POWER and dodge the missiles.
  * If target is in LONG range, missiles hit.
  * If target is in SHORT range, missiles miss.
  * Takes 1 turn to reload missiles.
  * Takes very little power, long waiting time.
* Particle Projector
  * Energy, increases the target's heat.
  * LONG range.
  * Takes a large amount of power.

what if real world paid like loot boxes in games like overwatch?

maybe there are some real world examples that are paid like that.  slot machines


the difference between a slot machine and a RNG that enhances gameplay/fun.

for example: diablo 1/2 loot system is the best i've played. followed bu boarderlands 1.

harthstone packs i do not mind because duplicates are recycled at prices based on rarity.  so you always win, which makes the cards feel like a safe investment.

gambling is very old, when money appears probably, what percentage of a population is addicted to gambling and what percentage resists? goal is to figure out which market is bigger.

is it better to drain a few people of all their money; or to get a little money from a lot of people. i assume this is a formula or graphs.

if the addicted market is large, the. the formula doesn't matter because draining a lot of people would provide the biggest profit (assuming costs stay the same).

my instincts tell me that there is a much larger of casual addiction people, or the term I lovingly use is Fan. The fans will not let you drain them, but they will spend a large amount over a longer period if time. you could call this the Disney model, as they have been buying and combining all the different fan bases.

i include fickle fans in this, because i think they are a larger share than die hard fans. its a scale, so the distinction doesnt matter that much.

Every Fan has $X they can spend a year on products, services, etc related to their fandom.

$X is limited by a number of factors, including: how much they make, other expenses like medical bills, housing, or anything else that would prevent then from spending as much as they would like too.

Fans are limited by a number if factors including; still living, know about the fandom, able to buy things from thr fandom.

So, to maximize sales, you need a lot of health, employed, people who make a lot of money.

todo: graph over time that shows the profit change over time as they factors go io and down.

  The next morning Rex checked his camp to make sure everything was still  ready. After weeks of searching he finally found what he had been looking for. The planet was once a thriving manufacturing hub. Centered around factories that produced the giant Mechs. That was kilo years ago. The wild planet had reclaimed the entire planet and the factory ran automatically from deep underground. The only thing that remained was old ruins and exit ports. Places where mechs will occasionally appear from deep underground.
  Rex laid in the grass, on a hill overlooking the remains of an ancient factory. His cybernetic eye displaying layout information. He had been watching a known exit point for over a week. Whenever or however the factory worked, it occasionally still produced a new Mech. The type and kind of Mech seemed random to Rex. (If he was a better student, he could have found loot tables on the internet, which are statistics charts breaking down the chance of any particular type of Mech being manufactured and how often they appear.)
  There was large deep footprints from the exit shaft and leading away from the factory. Signs that either a very heavy Mech was released recently, or there was a heavy rain when the last Mech was released. Rex was hoping it was the former. He dreamed of capturing an Annihilator or an Atlas. Both Mechs were perfect assault mechs for any battle team. The Star fighter in every team. Rex wanted that. He wanted to be the star, the assault mech. The one winning championships and getting sponsors and fans. Having more than enough to buy himself complete freedom. Whatever he might what whenever he wanted it. That was the dream.
  Rex grew up watching the Mech fights. Everyone watched them, and every business tried to cash in on them. Even as a child Rex could see that it was power; abet at the cost of freedom. He was going to get the next big Mech that came out of this port. A large flat metal surface on the ground. Rex figured it must open up or something, like an elevator shaft.
  Over the next week, Rex scouted the area looking for his goal. A wild Mech. These giant machines where manufactured by humans long ago, but sometime during one of the great wars, the factories became automated. The Mechs known in Rex's time start out as wild. Their AI brain acted randomly and without commands.
  If Rex was going to reach his dream of being a Mech Warrior champion, then first he needed a Mech.
  Rex followed the waypoint projected into this vision. This was a known Mech factory planet, used by several of the clans. It was considered neutral, and Rex was counting on that.
  Rex approached from a cliff several miles away. He pulled out a small circular object and placed it to his eye. The telescope controlled by his implant allowed him to zoom in on the remains of the old factory.

  * [Scan the building remains]
    The factory must have been massive back in the day. Back when people lived on this planet. Giant foundation stones still laid, leaving marks that gave an outline of the once great structure. With Mechs weighting up to 100 tons and stating 12 meters tall. Rex's imagination came up with all sorts of possibilities.
  * [Scan the perimeter]
    The ground around the exit was large and dense. Thousands or more of the giant war machines have walked out from that exit port over the years. It was impossible from scans alone to tell how often the mechs came out of the exit.

  -
  After scanning around, Rex grinned broadly. Just on the edge of the perimeter, stood a massive 100 ton Atlas.
  With a Mech like that, he would be unstoppable. Rex thought to himself. He could see himself now, stepping on the competition and making it all the way to the final rounds. Then Clan Lyran would offer him a fat contract to be on their team.
  Rex was mid daydream when a sonic boom overhead shook him out of it. He scanned the sky and quickly saw a drop ship landing near the factory.
  "Damn it" Rex muttered. He quickly grabbed his gear and started sliding down the cliff face, moving as fast as he could without falling. "I have to get to the Atlas first."
  Galactic laws allow anyone to claim any wild mech as their own. But once claimed, taking the mech would become stealing. Rex's only chance was to get the Mech to recognize him as it's pilot before the intruders could do the same.
  Once Rex reached the valley floor, he stopped a moment to catch his breath and scan the drop ship.
  The Ship was old, but not the ancient egg shaped ships used in the old wars. This looked more like a large cargo plane. The back opened up to let Mechs walk in and out of the craft.


  * [PROXIMITY ALERT] "The Hell?" was all Rex could manage before dropping the zoom and looking next to him. He almost yelled as a familiar black metal wolf sat down next to him. Rex was sure that Wolf wasn't there when he first reached the valley floor.

  -
  "Hey buddy" Rex said with an edge of nervousness in his voice.
  The Wolf turned its head a little, looking at Rex.
  "I would love to stop, but you see that giant over there?" Rex slowly reached out an arm and pointed. The Wolf looked in the direction for a moment. "I have to get to him before those people do" Rex pointed to the Drop Ship. The wolf looked again, sighed, stood up, and then started to walk towards the people.
  "Whoa wait!" Rex shouted.
  The wolf stopped, and looked back at him.
  "Can you understand me?"
  The Wolf just looked at him.
  "If you can, don't kill them. I just need a distraction."
  The Wolf turned back and started a light jog in the direction of the Drop Ship.

  * [Scan the people exiting the drop ship]
    // Rex scaned the ship and it's crew as they exited the Drop Ship. Five total, two in Mechs and three walking in light armor and personal jump jets. It was a pretty standard crew for a Mech hunt. A few soon to be pilots and a couple of seniors to make sure they don't get in over their head.
    With his augmented eyes and core computer, Rex's vision zoomed into the drop ship, his personal scanner overlying information. It was a small crew, only three people. Two adults and a girl around Rex's age. Rex knew what this was. He had seen many of the richer kids go off with a hired crew to help them catch their first mech.
    Rex's mind clouded with anger as he thought about those kids, able to buy their way here. He would show them, he thought. He would get that Atlas. He would prove to everyone that hard work and careful planning was superior to rich parents and a well connected family.
  * [Move quickly towards the Atlas]
    Rex wasted no time in moving to the Atlas. He would just have to hope that metal wolf creature understood him. Or at least the for the creature to not interrupt him again. After this was over, Rex told himself he was going to figure out how the wolf kept sneaking up on him. Right now he needed to stay focused on his goal or else he would lose it.

  -
  The giant 100 ton mech stood over 12 meters tall. Rex tried to keep anything he could between him and the Atlas directly. Trees, rocks, bits of grass, anything, no matter how impractical it would be in defense of a laser beam that was thicker than him. Or even a single missile for that matter. Most people wore armor when attempting to capture a Mech, and personal jump jets. The personal jump jets don't exactly allow you to fly; more like they allow you to jump very very good. Someone skilled with them can appear to fly or hover by jumping off small air currents. Rex thought that was non-sense.
  Rex got within a few meters of the Atlas before a barrage of missile struck ton the far side, away from Rex. He signed a breath of relief that he was not closer.
  The Atlas immediately responded by turning to face the attacker and unleashing an astonishing payload of twenty long range missiles, a Gauss rifle, and four laser blasts.
  The flash of light as the hulk of a machine fired made Rex shield his eyes. When he could see again he had spots in his vision and the air around him was significantly hotter.

  * [Next]
  -

  The attacking Mech unleashed another volley of missiles, this time the Atlas's missile defense took down the missiles before they hit. Two laser blasts his the Atlas along the side while it was distracted with the missiles.
  Rex saw the top of the Mech start to move, he had seen that attack before. Rex quickly pressed himself to the ground, trying to dig into the dirt as much as he could.
  The top of the Atlas started to spin, while it's feet started talking towards the attackers. As the spinning top of the Mech reached speed, it unleashed continues blasts of all four lasers. Creating a beam of death that cut though everything in it's path. As the Atlas walked, the ground was uneven, causing the beams to slice in arcs, sometimes cutting the ground and others firing into the sky.
  As Rex watches the carnage, he spots the three kids in armor jumping their way to the Atlas. Rex knew it was now or never, he was much closer to the Mech, but he didn't have armor or personal jump jets.
  Rex abandoned all sense of stealth and made a bold run towards the Atlas. It's laser barrage finnaly over, it's guns red hot from over heating and the spinning slowing to a stop. The Mech glowed red hot at the head sinks in it's body. That was a powerful but stupid attack. Now that the Atlas had overheated, it was a sitting duck.
  Rex reached the foot of the Atlas. A latter went up the left leg and to the torso, where the cockpit was located. Rex started climbing up the leg.

  * [Next]
  -

  A bullet shot rang next to Rex's ear causing him to lose grip on the ladder for a moment. We quickly hugged to it for dear life. Rex looked back and could see one the armored kids just reaching the foot of the Mech.
  "Who the hell are you?" A voice boomed out. "This is my Mech" said a female voice as the kid activated her personal jump jets and passed Rex on the ladder. She was jumping straight for the cockpit.
  Without thinking, Rex grabbed the boot as she flew by. The sudden shift in momentum caused her to lose control and crash against the side of the leg.
  The Atlas's leg started to lift. It was recovering from over heating. Rex jumped from the ladder, reaching for the open latch just outside the cockpit. The one the would open the door and stop the Atlas's rampage.
  Rex missed. He fell almost twenty meters to the compact dirt beneath the Mech with a hard thud.
  The armored kid, jumped for the cockpit, her hand touching the latch when the Atlas started to spin again. Its right cannon slammed into her armored body and sent her flying away from the machine. Sparks and metal sprayed into the air as the armor did it's job.
  Rex slowly opened his eyes, his head pounding, in fact, his whole body was pounding, and the ground. His eyes snapped open as he realized where he was. He was looking up between the legs of the giant Atlas as it stomped and fired constant laser blasts randomly.
  Rex couldn't move, his body unwilling or unable to respond. The Atlas's foot slammed down next to him. At first he heard nothing, the boom next to his ears drowned out the world. Then everything came flooding in as vivid colors. Rex screamed in pain as his left arm was crushed under the weight. His eyes filling with black spots as the leg rose again, ready to finish the job.

  * [Next]
  -

  A black form moved over Rex. It pulled at him, at his body. He could see the remains of his arm as blackness took him.

  * [Next]
  -

  Tammy crashed into the dirt. She took off her helmet and started to curse the meddler that cost her *her* mech. She grinned for a moment when the Atlas's foot came down next to the boy. Then she heard him scream and she instantly felt guilty for that smile.
  A giant creature thing ran past her, according to her implants it was traveling over 90 kph. The creature jumped between the Atlas's foot and the boy, pulling him away and.
  Tammy wasn't sure what she saw. The creature's body opened up along it's belly, the leggs grew in size as the boy was pulled inside as the creature turned into a four legged Mech. Tammy had be studying and training at the best schools to become a champion. She has never even heard of such a Mech. Sure there was fictional stories of transforming robots, but the physics did not work.
  Tammy made sure to save a recording of the transformation. But she didn't tell her teammates when they caught up to her. She told them all about the annoying boy that crashed her suit and cost her a chance at the Atlas.
  The Atlas, being more than Tammy could capture, was left alone and the team pulled back to find an easier target. Tammy protested but the leader said it was just too big of a risk for their small crew.

  Rex woke up back at his camp. His memory a confused haze of shadows and blurs. He went to sit up, but only his right arm found purchase for the push. In confusion he looked down and gasped. His left arm was gone.
  The visions and pain flooded his memory again. His arm was crushed underneath the Atlas.
  Rex's heart rate spiked as as panic took over him. The shock of his shoulder stump, with tires and tubes coming out of the stump. He felt like he was going to scream so loud that his chest will explode.
  * Wires and tubes?

  -
  The strangeness of it caught like a ledge in his mind. He as slipping over the edge, and then this little fact, his strangeness was enough purchase for his mind to hold on and drag itself back to reality.
  Rex followed the tubes and wires from his shoulder stump, along the ground, and out of the tent. Slowly Rex stood up, careful not to pull on the tubes and wires. He followed them out of the tent. The wires lead around the campfire and into the body of the black wolf.

  * "What did you do to me?"
    The wolf creature raised its head a little and sneered at Rex.
  * "Did you save me?"
    The wolf huffs into the dirt, it's glowing blue eyes not looking at Rex.

  -
//   "I am IronWolf" a voice said on his implanted headset.
  A new voice channel appeared in Rex's augmented vision. He accepted and a gruff voice spoke over the audio implants. "I am IronWolf." he said.
  Rex did not want to believe it, everything was happening all at once. A talking mech? A transforming mech that appears at the size of a wolf? Rex was not sure what was more crazy. He wanted to close his eyes and pretend the whole thing was a dream. But when he opened his eyes, the Wolf was still sitting there and his arm was still missing.
//   Instinctively he scanned for the source of the transmission. It was the creature. Rex thought back at the his memmory and could not remember the Mech over him, the foot over him. Everything as a jumbled mix in his head.
  "What are you?" Rex managed to ask.
  "I am IronWolf, and you are, my pilot." The wolfs eyes moved to watch him.
//   "You are a Mech? I've never seen anything like you before, or this" he pointed to the tubes running though the stump that was his arm.
  Rex couldn't help but laugh. He came out here to get a Mech. "I have never seen a mech like you before. Can you really change sizes? Are you really a wild Mech? Can all mechs talk? What is with this intricate tattoo around your body?"
  "There are many things you have never seen" The wold responded without lifting it's massive head.
  Rex chuckled, "yeah that's true. Why did you save me?"
  "You are my pilot"  IronWolf said.
  "Sure, that's awesome and I don't want to diminish how awesome and excited I am to be your pilot. I'm just wondering why you saved me before I was your pilot. It didn't exactly tame you."
  The wold stood up, its massive form hulking over Rex. "No," IronWolf said, "you did not *tame* me." The wolf stepped forward, forcing Rex to take a step back. "I saved you, because I think we can help each other."
  "Oh, how can I help you?" Rex stupidly asked because the writer couldn't think of anything better.
//   "There is a huge universe out there," IronWolf said as he laid back down. "And I am trapped here. Show me the universe and I'll help you reach your dream. Together we would be unstoppable.
  IronWolf seemed to think on this for a moment. "Do you now what it is like to be trapped? Stuck in a world you can not control, unable to do anything other than scream into the wind? I am trapped on this planet, and I need you to get me off."

  * [Next]
  -

  "Me? I do not have a ship. I had to stowaway just to get here." Rex said. "Even if I could, were do you want to go?"
  IronWolf's large head looked up into the night sky. He looked for a moment as if he would howl. "Everywhere" he said at long last.
  "I hope you can do that while we conquer the mech warrior battle circuit." Rex said. "The entire reason I wanted a mech is to fight."
  "I am not a slave" IronWolf said.
  "I'm the pilot" Rex said to himself. "So you have to do what I say."
  The wolf snorted.
  "You are my Mech now, you said I am your pilot." Rex said.
  "Yes, you are the pilot" the wolf said, "but I am the body. You can not make me do anything."
  "Uh yeah I can, open up." Rex walked over to the Mech and tapped on the wolfs chest.
  The wolf looked at his hand, and then back at Rex. "You do not command me little human, I could kill you just as easily as that Atlas."
  "I thought that's how it worked." Rex said, "The pilot controls the Mech, driving it and firing the weapons to victory or defeat."
  "Listen" The wolf looked into Rex's eyes. "Everything you think of as you, the part that makes plans and decisions and has hopes and dreams. That part, is a little tiny piece of your brain called the Frontal Cortex."
  "Uh ok" Rex said.
  "When you decide to move your body, it's really you the Frontal Cortex piloting your body. Haven't you ever noticed that the You that other people see, is not the same you that you know and experience?"
  "So a Mech pilot is like the Frontal Cortex?"
  "Exactly", said IronWolf, "I am the body, and you are my pilot. Alone we will both fail, but together we can do amazing things."
  "So you do what I say" Rex said with a grin.
  IronWolf let out a big exhaust. "Does your body do everything you command it?"
  "Of course" Rex responded without thinking.
  "You have never done something and later asked yourself why you did it? You have never had an outburst and said or did things you regret? Have you never felt the pull of temptation, then the flooding guilt after giving in?"
  "Uhh" Rex didn't know how to respond to that.
  "Together we can achieve your goal of winning the championship, and my goal to see the universe. But I am not your slave. What do you say?" The Mech asked.

  * "Lets do it"
    IronWolf smiled, you don't waste time, I like that.
  * "I was hoping for stronger Mech actually, like that Atlas."
    IronWolf snorts into the dirt. "That's clown? Big and dumb have their uses sure, but you won't win the grand tournament with a relic like that."
    "Oh sure" Rex said, "one hit and you would be a goner."
    "He would have to hit me first" IronWolf said.
  * "What are all these tubes and wired you hooked into me?"
    "You where bleeding out. I needed to do something or else you would have died. So I've been running my self repair fluid though your system."
    Rex gasped and his hand went to pull out the tube.
    "Hold on, it's not going to hurt you. Just basic repair to keep you from bleeding out.

  -
  Rex felt around his missing joint. Pressing in on the skin and flinching when it hurt. "Does this mean I'll get my arm back? Rex said hopefully.
  "Oh" said the wolf. "Human limbs don't naturally regrow?" He seemed to go into thought. "yeah that makes sense. I was wondering why you were just bleeding instead of healing the wound."

  Rex sat down, his body weak and his emotions wrong hum dry. "How much longer do I need this?" he said waving the cables and tubes.
  "At least until the morning." IronWolf said.

  Tammy unloaded her broken power armor in the corner of the loading dock. She paused for a moment to kick the metal scrap.
//   Tammy kicked her broken armor suit. After the failed hunt of the Atlas, the team moved on to let the others hunt their Mechs. Rose managed to find and capture an Axman, and a Blackjack. Neither was good as an Atlas. Tammy kicked the broken armor again.
  "Calm down" said Phil, the officer in charge of the hunt. "You'll get another chance to get a Mech."
  Tammy sneared at him, "The Atlas?"
//   He frowned, "No, that Mech was more than you could handle. You are lucky it didn't crush you." He looked at the broken armor. "Or lucky owned you have such high end armor."
  "That mech was more than you could handle. The boy it crushed learned that lesson the hard way." Phil said.
  Wilson poked his head into the room, "Lucky she can afford top of the line armor." he sniped.
  "I can take the Atlas" Tammy protested. "That boy got in the way."
  "If he had not gotten in the way, I would be contacting your family about their crushed daughter." He walked over and loomed over the girl. His face moving to inches in front of hers. "You are lucky to be alive at all."
//   "That boy was probably crushed to death for his stupidly. Imaging, trying to capture a Mech by yourself. Not even, he tried to capture an Atlas by himself."
//   Willson poked his head in, showing that he had been eavesdropping on the conversation. "I think that boy just wanted to die. Nothing else explains it."
//   Wilson poked his head in again, still eavesdropping on their conversation. "There are a lot of mechs out there." he said. "if you get too hung up on your first one, you will miss all the others you could have experienced.
  Wilson poked his head in again. He was in the ship's cockpit, which was attacked to the main cargo area. "Maybe you two should hug it out?" he suggested.
  "Did you find another Mech yet?" Phil called back.
  "Actually, yeah, but she's not going to like it." Willson responded.

  * "What kind of Mech is it?"

  -
  The room filled with the augmented projection of the local terrain. Out along a tree line, pillars of smoke could be seen. The trees burning from multiple spots, indicating a random blaze.
  Will typed in a command and the view zoomed in and focused on a Wolfhound, a short 35 ton mech.
  "No" Tammy said simply.
  They watched as the Mech jogged though the trees, blasting at random with its lasers. As they watched, a window filled with stats about the Mech.
  "Five lasers and heavy armor that acts as a heat sink. That slow Atlas knocked itself out every time it fired its lasers. This thing is cruising at a good seventy kilometers per hour and firing like crazy." Phil said. "I would rather have this Mech by my side than the walking target. Willson, get the crew ready, Tammy is about to get her first Mech."
  "Yes sir" said Willson.

  -
  By the time they reached the Wolfhound, it had stopped in a river and was just standing there. Engine readings showed that the Mech was in a low power mode.
  "Maybe it's sleeping after its tantrum" Willson joked.
  "With any luck, Tammy can board without combat" Phil added.
  Tammy rolled her eyes, "Fine, lets get this over with." She was in a set of backup armor the team and brought with them. It was used and old and had no personal jump jets. Tammy was going to have to climb up the Mech's leg to reach the cockpit.
  "I think my Tora can handle one lone Wolfhound" Phil said. "This is a stealth mission, so I want the rest of you to stay back. Watch the scanners and let us know if anything unexpected shows up."
  "Yes Sir" Willson said.

  * [Next]
  -

  Soon Tammy was moving along the river, making her way behind the Mech. She did not need to be that careful. The Machine was the size of the three story building.
  The Mech had a human like shape. Instead of a right hand, the Wolfhound had a large laser cannon. And instead of a round head, it looked more like someone landed a very small plane on the Mechs shoulders and cut off the wings, but left the tail.
  That stupid boxy cockpit was all the way at the top of the Mech, on its shoulders like a head. Tammy thought to herself as she approached from behind. She was sure it would detect her before she reached the release latch.
  The plan, according to Phil, was that he would keep the Mech from running away with Long Range Missiles.  When she protested that the Mech could still just crush her, Phil shrugged and said "You should probably keep that in mind while you are out there."
  The Mech Wolfhound was sitting in the river. Its legs bend up into its chest, arms wrapped around its knees.
  Trying to move with the sounds of nature, Tammy slipped into the river and made her way up behind the Wolfhound. The river had a swift flow towards the machine. Tammy found a good size branch and floated down the river to the robot. She positioned herself so when the tree branch hit the Mech, she jumped/reached just high enough to catch a ladder rung on the back of the Mech.
  The Wolfhound moved his right arm and reached behind him. The massive laser, large enough that Tammy could walk inside of it, scrapped along the Mechs back as it smashed the tree branch into pieces small enough that they flowed around the Mech and further down the river.

  * [Next]
  -

  "Do you think she'll do it?" Willson asked Phil over their private channel.
  "She's almost there, she can do it." Phil responded.

  As the Mech brought it arm back around, to wrap around its knees again, Tammy quickly jumped up and along the arm, using the moving surface to get her quickly up to the head. She landed on the Mechs right shoulder.
  "I did it!" she yelled.

  The Wolfhound stood up, Tammy lost her footing and started to fall off the Mech. She finds purchase for her fingers along the Mechs armored neck plate. Tammy hanging by her fingers, starts to shimmy to the left shoulder while the Mech turns its head and brushed at its right shoulder. When it found nothing there it turned around. Tammy strained against the forces trying to pull her off the Mech as it moved. She barely hung on, but managed to reach the left shoulder.
  She pulled the release level on the left side of the Mech head. It's movements suddenly slowing and then stopping. It's shoulders leveled out as it stood up straight, making it easer for Tammy to keep her footing. The door opened, inside was a black leather chair surrounded by controls and displays. She got in, and the door automatically closed after her.
  Tammy was in complete darkness. Her heart raced in that long moment. Her brain flashing worries and doubts into the darkness. Did she do something wrong? Is there a button? If this is light proof, is it also air tight? How much air would be in a cockpit of this size?  When did I start breathing so fast? Why can't I stop breathing so fast?
  A faint blue light started in front of her and slowly grew in brightness. The screens and controls lighting up. Soon she could see a 180 arch in front of her. The metal walls seemingly to turn translucent, giving her a great view. She smiled and gently pushed forward on the controls. The Mech started walking forward. She pushed a little harder and the Wolfhound broke into a full sprint. Tammy started laughing as she pressed harder on the controls. She jerked back on the control and the Mech switched poses to a skidding stop, leaving a deep grove in the ground were she slid.
  Tammy looked around and spotted a tree not too far away. She used the joystick to target lock on the tree and fired the large laser. A bright flash of red and white light came from the Wolfhounds cannon arm. The blast disintegrated the tree, leaving nothing but a burn mark.
  "Alright" Tammy said into the team channel. "I'll keep her."
  Willson laughed for a moment before he cut his mike.
  "Great, let's pack it up" Phil said in the channel. "Time to go home and get paid."
