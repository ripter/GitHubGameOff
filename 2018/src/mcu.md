## MCU conclusion to infinity wars.

Captain Marvel kills Thanos, the snap is not reversed. Everyone that died stays dead or they are "alive" in another dimension that our "living" Heros can only visit.

Tony gets a crazy idea to reverse the Snap, and is sure of his theory because Dr Strange saved him. Tony assumes this means he can fix everything, or else Dr Strange would have held on to the stone.

Tony does everything he can to invent a way out, including rescuring Ant-Man from the quantion realm. Together they will figure out something they think will work.

Captain Marvel arrives, finds out what happened, and goes out to fight Thanos. Eventually it comes down to beating Thanos and using Tony's new tech to save everyone.

Tony's device does not work as expected, and the snap become permeant. Thanos is killed or forced to live with the people he snapped.

The existence of the super powered aliens are revealed and the mutations they caused in humans (inhumans/xman) will be official revealed to the entire world. A new group of Heros will band together and go out into the comos.
