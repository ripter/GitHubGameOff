# Ideas about distance and power.
For all of this, we will assume a standard mech, perfectly average with all values at the base level. Once we have this, we can make special adjustments and scaling as needed.

Distance between the two fighting mechs determine their fighting range. Long Range, Medium Range, and Short Range. Every 5 POWER changes the range by 1 in either direction. This is a total movement spent by each mech.
>>> Attacker uses 3 power to move forward, range is still long.
>>> Defender uses 2 power to move forward, range is now medium because a total of 5 power was used moving forward (aka moving towards each other)


## Range Weapons
* Long Range
** Missiles, Guass Rifles
* Medium Range
** Lasers, Autocannon
* Short Range
** Melee Weapons, Lasers, Autocannons

what if real world paid like loot boxes in games like overwatch?

maybe there are some real world examples that are paid like that.  slot machines


the difference between a slot machine and a RNG that enhances gameplay/fun.

for example: diablo 1/2 loot system is the best i've played. followed bu boarderlands 1.

harthstone packs i do not mind because duplicates are recycled at prices based on rarity.  so you always win, which makes the cards feel like a safe investment.

gambling is very old, when money appears probably, what percentage of a population is addicted to gambling and what percentage resists? goal is to figure out which market is bigger.

is it better to drain a few people of all their money; or to get a little money from a lot of people. i assume this is a formula or graphs.

if the addicted market is large, the. the formula doesn't matter because draining a lot of people would provide the biggest profit (assuming costs stay the same).

my instincts tell me that there is a much larger of casual addiction people, or the term I lovingly use is Fan. The fans will not let you drain them, but they will spend a large amount over a longer period if time. you could call this the Disney model, as they have been buying and combining all the different fan bases.

i include fickle fans in this, because i think they are a larger share than die hard fans. its a scale, so the distinction doesnt matter that much.

Every Fan has $X they can spend a year on products, services, etc related to their fandom.

$X is limited by a number of factors, including: how much they make, other expenses like medical bills, housing, or anything else that would prevent then from spending as much as they would like too.

Fans are limited by a number if factors including; still living, know about the fandom, able to buy things from thr fandom.

So, to maximize sales, you need a lot of health, employed, people who make a lot of money.

todo: graph over time that shows the profit change over time as they factors go io and down.
