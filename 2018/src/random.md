what if real world paid like loot boxes in games like overwatch?

maybe there are some real world examples that are paid like that.  slot machines


the difference between a slot machine and a RNG that enhances gameplay/fun.

for example: diablo 1/2 loot system is the best i've played. followed bu boarderlands 1.

harthstone packs i do not mind because duplicates are recycled at prices based on rarity.  so you always win, which makes the cards feel like a safe investment.

gambling is very old, when money appears probably, what percentage of a population is addicted to gambling and what percentage resists? goal is to figure out which market is bigger.

is it better to drain a few people of all their money; or to get a little money from a lot of people. i assume this is a formula or graphs.

if the addicted market is large, the. the formula doesn't matter because draining a lot of people would provide the biggest profit (assuming costs stay the same).

my instincts tell me that there is a much larger of casual addiction people, or the term I lovingly use is Fan. The fans will not let you drain them, but they will spend a large amount over a longer period if time. you could call this the Disney model, as they have been buying and combining all the different fan bases.

i include fickle fans in this, because i think they are a larger share than die hard fans. its a scale, so the distinction doesnt matter that much.

Every Fan has $X they can spend a year on products, services, etc related to their fandom.

$X is limited by a number of factors, including: how much they make, other expenses like medical bills, housing, or anything else that would prevent then from spending as much as they would like too.

Fans are limited by a number if factors including; still living, know about the fandom, able to buy things from thr fandom.

So, to maximize sales, you need a lot of health, employed, people who make a lot of money.

todo: graph over time that shows the profit change over time as they factors go io and down.
